       "<p>Avian influenza continues to be a significant threat to poultry production in Canada. The Government of Canada is committed to reinforcing the sector's capacity to respond to disease outbreaks in the future.</p>\n",
       "<p>Today, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, announced an investment of $1.81 million over three years to support the British Columbia (BC) Poultry Association's preparation for direct participation in responses to future outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the province.</p>\n",
       "<p>The BC Poultry Association represents the supply-managed regulated poultry sectors – chicken, turkey, table egg, and hatching eggs – on common issues to support the commercial poultry sector.</p>\n",
       "<p>HPAI is a significant risk for the poultry industry across Canada. The most recent outbreak of HPAI was unprecedented in terms size, geographical distribution and duration. Within British Columbia there is a highly concentrated production zone in the Fraser Valley which is also located in the Pacific flyway for migratory birds and home to a significant number of wild birds year-round. These unique factors require strong farm biosecurity at all times and an effective, timely disease response when there is an outbreak of HPAI.</p>\n",
       "<p>This investment will support the BC Poultry Association:</p>\n",
       "<ul>\n",
       "<li>Creating and implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for comprehensive training, personal protection equipment (PPE) inventories and rotation, secondary destruction methods and hiring contractors;</li>\n",
       "<li>Creating and tendering a contract for a primary supplier for destruction, biocontainment and training as well as secondary destruction capacity to assist if there is a surge in infected premises;</li>\n",
       "<li>Developing a partnership with BC AgSafe to assist with worker safety during training and annual fit tests for workers requiring PPE; and</li>\n",
       "<li>Developing and building strategic partnerships with BC Ministry of Agriculture and Food, processors and allied trades for an effective HPAI response.</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",

Upon completion of this three-year project, we will have improved capacity to respond to future detections, with at least two companies with multiple teams that are fully trained in worker safety, humane destruction, and biocontainment. Partnering with the CFIA on building capacity for HPAI response will benefit all poultry producers, poultry processors, feed companies, and hatcheries in BC. A rapid response to HPAI will benefit all British Columbians through reduced disease spread and increased food security.\"</p>\n",

Minister Blair congratulated Secretary Shapps on his recent appointment and noted that he looks forward to building upon the excellent defence relationship between Canada and the United Kingdom. Minister Blair and Secretary Shapps condemned Russia’s ongoing, illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine, and discussed the ongoing collaboration between Canada and the United Kingdom to support Ukraine. Through Operation UNIFIER, approximately 170 Canadian Armed Forces members are deployed in the United Kingdom, where they have trained 2,600 Ukrainian recruits in collaboration with the British Operation INTERFLEX. Minister Blair visited Camp Lydd on September 17, 2023, and saw first-hand how Canadian and British military members are working together. In addition, a Royal Canadian Air Force detachment is currently deployed in Prestwick, Scotland. The detachment operates three CC-130 Hercules aircraft and has delivered over 11 million pounds of Ukraine-bound military aid donated by Canada, partners, and allies. As Minister Blair announced on September 17, 2023, Canada is also contributing $33 million (CAD) to the British-led partnership delivering high priority air defence equipment to Ukraine. Secretary Shapps welcomed this announcement, and both Minister Blair and Secretary Shapps looked forward to future collaboration between Canada and the United Kingdom in support of Ukraine. Minister Blair discussed Canada’s ongoing efforts to update its defence policy and noted that several of Canada’s investments in military capabilities involve close collaboration with the United Kingdom. Through a $1.168 billion contract awarded in December 2022 to Leonardo United Kingdom Ltd, Canada is upgrading its Cormorant search and rescue helicopter fleet. In addition, Canada is investing in 15 new Canadian Surface Combatant warships, whose design will be based on BAE’s Type 26 warship, bolstering interoperability between the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Navy. Minister Blair and Secretary Shapps also noted the ongoing participation of the Canadian and British militaries in joint exercises. More than 140 Royal Canadian Air Force personnel are currently participating in Exercise COBRA WARRIOR 23-2, a British-hosted multinational live-fly exercise held at Royal Air Force (RAF) station Waddington in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force is also participating in the ongoing Canadian-led Exercise CUTLASS FURY 2023 off the coast of Nova Scotia. The two counterparts agreed to stay in close communication and looked forward to working together.  \n",

      "News Release Text: Avian influenza continues to be a significant threat to poultry production in Canada. The Government of Canada is committed to reinforcing the sector's capacity to respond to disease outbreaks in the future. Today, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, announced an investment of $1.81 million over three years to support the British Columbia (BC) Poultry Association's preparation for direct participation in responses to future outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the province. The BC Poultry Association represents the supply-managed regulated poultry sectors – chicken, turkey, table egg, and hatching eggs – on common issues to support the commercial poultry sector. HPAI is a significant risk for the poultry industry across Canada. The most recent outbreak of HPAI was unprecedented in terms size, geographical distribution and duration. Within British Columbia there is a highly concentrated production zone in the Fraser Valley which is also located in the Pacific flyway for migratory birds and home to a significant number of wild birds year-round. These unique factors require strong farm biosecurity at all times and an effective, timely disease response when there is an outbreak of HPAI. This investment will support the BC Poultry Association: This investment will enable industry-led destruction and biocontainment activities that will be completed with oversight from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) so that overall response capacity is expanded without increased risk for animal welfare or disease spread.\n",

      "News Release Text: The New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP) is a federal grants and contributions program that supports projects that empower seniors in their communities and contribute to improving their health and well-being. NHSP funding supports community-based projects and pan-Canadian projects. The projects are led or inspired by seniors who are making a difference in the lives of others and their communities. Through the NHSP, the Government of Canada encourages seniors to share their knowledge, skills and experience to the benefit of others. The objectives of the NHSP are: Since the NHSP was launched in 2004, more than 23,600 projects have been funded across Canada. With a proposed investment in Budget 2019 of $100 million over five years, and $20 million per year ongoing, including $15 million for community-based projects, the Government of Canada will be supporting even more projects. Community-based projects Community-based project funding supports activities where seniors are engaged, connected and actively involved in their communities. Organizations are eligible to receive up to $25,000 in grant funding, and small grants of up to $5,000 are available to organizations that have not received funding within the last five years. As part of the 2019-20 NHSP community-based call for proposals, organizations are invited to apply for funding under the NHSP’s three national priorities: Approximately 2000 projects across Canada were approved through last year’s NHSP call for proposals for community-based projects, many of which are still in progress. For more information, visit The New Horizons for Seniors Program (NHSP). Pan-Canadian projects Pan-Canadian projects test and share best practices across the country and replicate approaches that have worked well in addressing seniors’ issues. As part of a collective impact approach, project partners work together to achieve measurable results in increasing social inclusion of seniors. The objectives of collective impact projects funded through the NHSP pan-Canadian stream are to: Build the collective capacity of organizationsPromote improved access to information, programs and services for seniorsSupport action research for increasing the level of social inclusionDevelop innovative approaches to engage senior volunteersAddress systemic barriers that contribute to the social exclusion of seniors For more information, visit Funding: New Horizons for Seniors Program – pan-Canadian projects.\n",

      "News Release Text: Immigration is key to building strong Atlantic communities and improving the region’s ability to compete in a global market. Increased immigration can play a significant role in meeting the skills shortages limiting economic development. Thanks to investments by the federal and provincial governments, an initiative is underway to research and prototype new solutions to the complex challenges of immigrant retention in New Brunswick. The initiative is being led by NouLAB, New Brunswick’s Social and Public Innovation Lab which is a joint-program of the University of New Brunswick’s Pond-Deshpande Centre and Social Policy Research Network.  Matt DeCourcey, Member of Parliament for Fredericton and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), was joined by the Honourable Gilles LePage, New Brunswick Minister of Labour, Employment and Population Growth, along with Karina LeBlanc, Executive Director of the Pond-Deshpande Center, to make the announcement today. NouLab’s in-depth process will bring together numerous perspectives, including those of new Canadians, settlement agencies, municipalities, academia, provincial and federal governments, and the public-at-large. The results of NouLAB’s research will lead to more coordinated, strategic, and integrated solutions to increase population growth through immigrant retention in New Brunswick. The Government of Canada is providing a non-repayable contribution of $190,000 to this initiative under ACOA’s Business Development Program. The Province of New Brunswick is also contributing $222,000 though the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour. This project builds on the federal and provincial governments’ commitment to drive economic growth in Atlantic Canada through the Atlantic Growth Strategy, which places an emphasis on increasing immigration to help confront one of the most critical issues faced by the Atlantic region.\n",

      "News Release Text: In lieu of an in-person update to the media, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, issued the following statement today: \"There have been 127,358 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 9,108 deaths. 89% of people have now recovered. Labs across Canada tested an average of almost 48,000 people daily over the past week with 0.7% testing positive. An average of 425 new cases have been reported daily during the most recent seven days. Local public health authorities across Canada are continuing to work hard to investigate cases and clusters of COVID-19. These core public health activities are essential to interrupt transmission chains, keep the infection rate low, and maintain epidemic growth on the controlled, slow burn track. The weekly average for Canada's daily case count has increased to an average of 425 cases being reporting daily over the past week, compared to 400 or less cases reported daily during the previous week. Increases in cases have been observed in Western and Prairie regions of Canada, with British Columbia and Manitoba each reporting a 24 percent increase in weekly cases last week. Elsewhere, notable decreases in weekly reported cases were reported from Saskatchewan and Quebec last week. Where cases are increasing, provinces are reporting outbreaks in healthcare settings including long-term care homes; workplaces including meat-processing plants; and in localised areas within small communities. During the month of August, an increase in food, drink and retail associated outbreaks have also been reported. These latter settings likely serve younger age groups that are currently experiencing the highest incidence rates for COVID-19 infection across the country. For public health professionals, budding epidemiologists and ever-curious life long learners, you can find detailed information on the latest epidemiology of COVID-19 in Canada in the Public Health Agency of Canada's Weekly Epidemiology Report for August 16-22, 2020, here. As we all look forward to getting back to the things we enjoy and re-engaging in activities that are important for our physical, social and economic wellbeing, we'll all need to keep up with personal precautions and be mindful of controls, protocols and policies being implementing in indoor settings to reduce our risk of exposure and spreading the virus. You can find additional information and guidance to increase your COVID-19 know how, including ways to keep you, your family and our communities safer here.\"\n",

      "News Release Text: Even during a pandemic, Canada continues to strengthen the economy while protecting and conserving our natural environment, supporting our natural resource sectors and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Increasing our understanding of the long-term cumulative effects from human activities is essential in making decisions that impact our future well-being. This is why Natural Resources Canada, in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada, has launched the Open Science and Data Platform (OSDP) for cumulative effects, an innovative online tool that provides Canadians with access to data and scientific publications that can be used to understand the cumulative effects of human activities. Cumulative effects are the accumulated changes in the environment caused by interactions between human activities and natural processes that have long-lasting impacts on the environment and the health and well-being of Canadians. Examples include changes to wildlife populations, changes in the ways in which ecosystems function, increases in non-native plants and permafrost melt. Understanding the effects of such activities will support science-based decision-making and help us better manage our land, its biodiversity, our water and other natural resources.  With the OSDP, Canadians and Indigenous communities, including scientists, researchers and policy-makers, can contribute to and easily access cumulative effects information, which until recently was widely dispersed across numerous government websites and repositories. Users can search cumulative effects content and view, combine and download data and publications and stay informed of proposed or current development activities across the country. The OSDP leverages the Federal Geospatial Platform (and its public facing site, Open Maps) which brings together open federal, provincial and territorial geospatial data to enable users to explore location-based data on the Government of Canada’s open Government Portal. By leveraging the Federal Geospatial Platform, the OSDP’s data provides enhanced access to provincial and territorial data, historical time series data and maps, surveys, satellite Earth observations and scientific models. The platform is an ambitious undertaking, and this is a first step that will continue to improve as user feedback is collected and analyzed. New data and publications will be added regularly to include the best available information relevant to cumulative effects and development activities in Canada. Visit the OSDP to learn more.\n",

      "News Release Text: The governments of Canada and Manitoba have agreed to increase the 2021 AgriStability interim benefit payment percentage from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for Manitoba producers, Federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Marie-Claude Bibeau and Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development Minister Ralph Eichler announced today. The interim benefit provides the opportunity for producers who are enrolled in AgriStability to access a portion of their benefit early, to help support losses and cover costs. With this increase, Manitoba producers can apply for an interim benefit to receive 75 per cent of their estimated final 2021 benefit, before completing their program year. Manitoba is also invoking the late participation option for producers not currently participating in AgriStability. Payments to late participants will be reduced by 20 per cent prior to applying any other deductions or penalties. The interim benefit is calculated based on the estimated margin decline or loss for the year compared to the farming operation's reference margin. The decline must be at least 30 per cent below the reference margin to access a payment. If a producer receives an interim benefit payment, they must still file all final program year forms and meet program requirements by the assigned deadlines. Manitoba will also be waiving AgriStability structural change for eligible 2022 program participants to ensure producers maintain their level of support and are not penalized for any significantly reduced productive capacity resulting from this year’s extreme weather events. AgriStability is an important tool that can help manage risks and financial losses because of poor yields, low commodity prices, or rising input costs. The program provides support when a producer experiences a large margin decline. Participants may be eligible for an interim payment as an advance on their final 2021 AgriStability benefit. The deadline to apply for an interim payment is March 31, 2022. Access AgriStability information with My AAFC Account, visit the AgriStability website www.agriculture.canada.ca/agristability or call toll-free at 1-866-367-8506 for more information. AgriStability is one of the business risk management (BRM) programs under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The Government of Manitoba, Manitoba Agriculture Services Corporation (MASC), and the Government of Canada, continue to stay in regular contact with producers, stakeholders, and provincial counterparts to confront the challenges of drought across Western Canada. \n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is making smart investments that lead to shared growth and create opportunities and jobs for the middle class and those working hard to join it. Today, Finance Minister Bill Morneau met with business leaders and community members in Pickering, which was named as a one of the world's Smart21 Communities of 2017 for its commitment to creating a more connected, engaged, inclusive, and sustainable city through its application of broadband, information and communications technology. This award program, hosted by the Intelligent Community Forum, recognizes the world's leading municipalities that are successfully leveraging the power of technology to develop inclusive and prosperous communities. Following a tour of the Pickering Public Library, Minister Morneau highlighted the one-year anniversary of the Canada Child Benefit, which has been providing nine out of ten families with children more in child benefits since it came into effect in July, 2016. Compared to the child benefit system it replaces, the CCB is simpler, more generous, tax-free, and better-targeted to those who need it most. The Minister also spoke about new action to improve the fairness of Canada's tax system, closing tax loopholes and amending existing rules so that people in similar circumstances pay similar amounts of tax.  This work includes the launch of a public consultation paper on Tuesday in Ottawa, relating to tax planning strategies involving the use of private corporations—strategies that can result in high-income individuals gaining tax advantages that are not available to other Canadians. Later today, the Minister will tour the Joyfully Organic Farm, highlighting the Government's work to position Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector as a leader in the global economy—one that can take full advantage of innovative new approaches, helping create new jobs and contributing to economic growth. The Government's ambitious plan will build a stronger middle class through investments in people (a middle class tax cut, the Canada Child Benefit, education, and skills training), in our communities (housing, roads, bridges and green infrastructure) and in our economy (innovation, smart cities and digital).

      "News Release Text: Victoria, British Columbia - The Government of Canada is committed to revitalizing its world-class marine industry and to ensuring the women and men of the Canadian Coast Guard have the equipment they need to carry out their important work including supporting scientific research on our oceans and marine ecosystems.  Today, the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, the Honourable Bernadette Jordan, along with Mario Pelletier, Commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard, welcomed the newly-built Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CGGS) John Cabot, to the Coast Guard fleet. The delivery of this third and final Offshore Fisheries Science Vessel (OFSV), along with the acceptance of the CCGS Sir John Franklin and the CCGS Capt Jacques Cartier in 2019, marks the completion of the first class of large ships built under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. It is a significant milestone in the renewal of the Coast Guard fleet while also supporting Canadian technological innovation, and bringing jobs and prosperity to many communities across the country.   Built in Canada by Seaspan Shipyards, these ships will ensure that Fisheries and Oceans’ scientists are working with the best equipment to conduct their vital work on fishery resources, other marine species and their environments. The OFSVs will also support environmental response and search and rescue operations, helping to ensure marine safety and environmental protection which are also key components of the Government of Canada’s $1.5B Oceans Protection Plan.  The National Shipbuilding Strategy is providing the Canadian Coast Guard and Fisheries and Oceans Canada scientists with the ships they need to make sure our waters are safer, cleaner and healthier for all Canadians. The CCGS John Cabot will soon travel from the West Coast to its home base in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n",

Now in its 13th season, the Hothouse theme for this year was “100,” which filmmakers were free to use as a quantifying descriptor, a playful graphic element, a musical guide or just a creative jumping-off point. In their shorts, the young animators have channeled this theme in ways that reflect their own richly diverse backgrounds. The Hothouse 13 cohort features the talents of: Renowned animation filmmaker Howie Shia is this year’s mentoring director, with Maral Mohammadian producing. This summer, the Hothouse animators have been able to take part in major animation events to build skills, make new connections and find out what’s happening in the industry. In June, they travelled to the Annecy International Animation Film Festival and Market in France for a unique opportunity to meet and network with peers from around the world.

      "News Release Text: September 18, 2020 — Iqaluit, Nunavut — Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) COVID-19 has had a severe impact on businesses of all sizes, and those whose livelihoods depend on them. In Nunavut, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) have faced challenges keeping their employees, paying rent and managing cash flow. From the outset, the Government of Canada has taken action to support them, most notably through the territory-specific Northern Business Relief Fund (NBRF) and the pan-Canadian Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). Significantly increasing the budget of CanNor and the other regional development agencies, the RRRF supports businesses unable to get access to other relief measures, while the NBRF is tailored to the unique needs of Northern businesses. As the economy reopens, the federal government continues to make major investments to protect jobs and support Nunavut businesses. Today, Larry Bagnell, Parliamentary Secretary to the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and Minister responsible for CanNor, announced that 46 businesses across Nunavut have received over $2.5 million in support from the NBRF and RRRF. Supporting good jobs in communities across Nunavut, these local businesses are the backbone of the Northern economy. They include SMEs from a variety of sectors: from accommodations and food services (11 SMEs supported), to tourism operators (6 SMEs supported), to construction (6 SMEs supported). With the effects of COVID-19 continuing to have an impact, CanNor is extending financial support to current eligible recipients of the NBRF program.\n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is committed to keeping Canadians safe and making the criminal justice system more accessible, efficient and effective. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are being felt throughout the criminal justice system, and particularly in the operation of criminal courts. The pandemic has both created and amplified challenges and limitations within the criminal justice system. Canada’s criminal courts have been adapting and modernizing to address the challenges they face, but many remain unable to operate at their pre-pandemic capacity. Today, the Honourable David Lametti, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, introduced an Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Identification of Criminals Act and to make related amendments to other Acts (COVID-19 response and other measures). The legislation was informed by discussions with provincial and territorial counterparts, and would help address challenges faced throughout the criminal justice system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has revealed the need for changes to help modernize our criminal justice system now and for the future. The Bill proposes a number of targeted and permanent changes to the Criminal Code that would give courts flexibility in how they hold criminal proceedings and issue orders. These changes would not compromise public safety, or participants’ rights and freedoms, and would support greater access to justice both during the pandemic and moving forward. More specifically, the Bill would make changes in the following areas: The Bill would also make eight minor technical changes to the Criminal Code and the Identification of Criminals Act that were identified during the implementation of former Bill C-75 (delays in the criminal justice system, 2019). These proposed changes would ensure that both victims and accused receive fair and timely justice by allowing the system to function in a safer, more effective, efficient and flexible manner. They would also help the criminal justice system manage the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the backlog of cases. These permanent changes are intended to help reduce the risks of further delays incurred during the pandemic and provide for increased efficiency both during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the long term. These provisions would also ensure that remote appearances remain an option that could be used only in appropriate circumstances, and that in-person hearings would remain the norm.\n",

      "News Release Text: Hi everyone. I am very happy to be here today. I would first like to acknowledge that the lands on which we are meeting are part of the traditional unceded territory of the Abénakis nation. I see Mr. Pierre Pomerleau, Director of Finance and Administration. Thank you, Pierre. Thank you to your team and, in particular, all the extraordinary workers at Royer. It was really inspiring for me to see what you do here, and it’s a great pleasure for me to be here with my colleague, Marie‑Claude Bibeau, and to be in the riding of another dear colleague, Élisabeth Brière. Royer is a proud Canadian company. Thousands of workers across the country and members of the Canadian Armed Forces proudly wear boots made here in Sherbrooke, Canada. Royer is one of thousands of companies that have received support from our Government with the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to get through the worst months of the pandemic. And that support—that allowed Royer to get through the worst recession since the Great Depression—worked. Canada has now recovered 117 per cent of the jobs lost during the worst months of the pandemic. In the United States, that figure is 96 per cent. The latest employment figures show a national unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. That is the lowest unemployment level recorded by Statistics Canada. The unemployment rate in Quebec is 4.2 per cent. Here, in Sherbrooke, it is 3.2 per cent. But I know that a strong labour market for workers also presents challenges to businesses. And our Government understands that. This was one of the priorities in the Budget I tabled in April. We are investing in the determined and talented workers who are already here, like the workers here at Royer. We are making it easier for our workers to move to where the jobs are, anywhere in Canada. We are investing in the skills that Canadian workers need to fill the good-paying jobs of today and tomorrow. This year’s Budget will make it easier for the skilled immigrants that our economy needs to make Canada their home. On immigration, I have good news. At a time when the world’s major economies are desperate for skilled workers, Canada has had, since 2016, the fastest growing population in the G7. Access to a skilled and diverse workforce is certainly part of a healthy economy. Unfortunately, this labour shortage is harming the world’s industrialized economies and supply chains. Canada is no exception. This is in addition to the inflation we are seeing around the world and that is hitting Canadians’ pocketbooks. About ten days ago, I presented our government’s plan to make life more affordable for Canadians. This plan includes measures that will come into effect this year: Just as we have helped Canadians and Canadian businesses like Royer get through the pandemic, we will be there to help them face the challenges ahead. I would like to conclude by saying that the slogan I have seen here at Royer – “respect for work” – is an excellent message and it is truly one of the key messages of our Government. Respect for work is the foundation of our economic policy, our approach to Canadians, to Quebecers, and I am very pleased to be here at Royer, to see the workers at such an inspiring factory that truly demonstrates respect for work. Thank you very much.\n",

Enhancing the northern transportation system supports and promotes economic growth and social development, offers job opportunities, ensures greater connectivity for Northerners, increases its resilience to a changing climate, and ensures that it can adapt to innovative technologies. Today, Michael McLeod, Member of Parliament for Northwest Territories, on behalf of the Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport, announced a major investment of over $4.7 million for two projects led by the Royal Military College of Canada to study the effects and impacts of climate change on transportation corridors and infrastructure in the Northwest Territories. The results of the first project will inform future transportation design best practices and have broad benefits that can apply to all northern communities. The second project will assess the overall performance of the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway at key locations, and will provide data on infrastructure performance in light of climate change. The study will also analyze future climate scenarios to develop a toolkit and best practices to support northern transportation infrastructure. These investments are expected to have important economic and employment benefits for Canada by creating an estimated 70 full time jobs during the studies. Projects in the North receiving funding are supporting northern transportation infrastructure such as ports, airports, all-season roads and bridges, and are enhancing safety, security, economic and/or social development in Canada's three territories. The projects are also addressing the unique and urgent transportation needs in Canada's territorial North, such as access to markets, economic opportunities, communities and essential services despite difficult terrain and severe climate conditions, and the high cost of construction along Canada’s northern trade corridors. Territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous groups, not-for-profit and for-profit private-sector organizations, and federal Crown Corporations and Agencies are all eligible for funding under the National Trade Corridors Fund.\n",

By investing in Canada’s critical minerals, we are creating well-paying jobs, strengthening our economy and supporting global agriculture producers while contributing to a greener future. Today, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, alongside the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, announced that the Government of Canada will support and enhance BHP’s effort to advance the development of its world-leading low emissions potash mine. Through this project, BHP will significantly minimize the carbon footprint of the mine, improve worker safety and implement technology to further reduce emissions from mine operations. This is the first new major potash project in Canada in over 50 years. This project will ensure Canada remains a global leader in both potash production and sustainable mining. It will also provide critical environmental benefits and long-term benefits for the people of Saskatchewan by securing well-paying jobs, supporting Indigenous communities through employment and economic opportunities, and cementing Canada’s leadership position in potash production. BHP has signed opportunities agreements with six First Nations, which are the first of their kind in southern Saskatchewan and in the potash industry. This mine, which will be developed in Jansen, Saskatchewan, is a major step forward and is expected to generate the lowest direct on-site emissions intensity of any potash mine.\n",

      "News Release Text: August 9, 2018 - Ottawa, ON - Health Canada The Government of Canada recognizes that medical assistance in dying is a deeply personal issue for all Canadians and must be addressed with the utmost compassion and empathy. It is critically important to monitor how the legislation is being implemented across the country to understand how the wishes of eligible patients are being carried out, and to protect the most vulnerable. Public reporting in this area is key to ensuring transparency and fostering public trust. Today, the Government of Canada published final regulations in Canada Gazette, Part II that create a federal pan-Canadian monitoring system on medical assistance in dying. The regulations set out reporting requirements for physicians and nurse practitioners who receive written requests for medical assistance in dying, and for pharmacists who dispense medication for assisted dying. Any personal data collected will be protected under the federal Privacy Act. The information will be used to publish annual reports on medical assistance in dying in Canada, including the number of requests received, the number of medically assisted deaths and the number of people found ineligible. The regulations come into force on November 1, 2018, and providers have until that date to become familiar with the new reporting requirements. Health Canada expects to continue to produce interim reports until the permanent monitoring and reporting system is operational. Annual federal reporting using the data collected under the Regulations is expected to begin in 2019.\n",

      "News Release Text: Dr. Guy Berthiaume, Librarian and Archivist of CanadaOntario Museums Association conferenceFour Points by Sheraton, Kingston, OntarioOctober 12, 2017, 9:45 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Check against delivery Good morning. Let me first acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Thank you for inviting me to share with you my thoughts on the future of memory institutions, the so-called GLAM sector. Thank you also for inviting me to celebrate my 67th birthday with you, by taking a Thousand Islands cruise last night. I’d like to start this morning with a premise. That in this age of post-truth, fake news and alternative reality, people need memory institutions like libraries, archives, galleries and museums more than ever… We are often told we are on our way out, but I’d like you to use your imaginations and picture the following: Walking into a library. And finding no books, no magazines, no newspapers. Imagine heading out for a night of theatre, the ballet, or the opera. And finding only dark, empty stages. Imagine galleries with no art. And museums with no artifacts or historical documents. In other words, imagine a country with no culture. No history. No identity. Or, to quote my friend Simon Brault, the Director and CEO of the Canada Council for the Arts, imagine a country with: “No Culture, No Future.” Somehow, the idea of our absence speaks more eloquently on our behalf than our presence. So, why are we still working so hard to justify our existence as cultural institutions? People ask: In a society where digital access is everywhere, why should we build new libraries? Since virtual museums offer culture and history to people across the country and around the world—who needs the expense of bricks and mortar? And what about archives—can’t you get everything you need from their own platforms, or those of Ancestry or Findmypast? For those of us who spend countless hours with artifacts, books and archives, these questions might sound ridiculous. Isn’t the value of our organizations obvious? Yet, I assure you, these questions are being asked every day, despite the fact that our visitor numbers are on the rise. Some of you may know there is a proposal in the works to create a new super-library in downtown Ottawa, a collaboration between Library and Archives Canada and the Ottawa Public Library. The proposal has generated a lot of discussion, most of it positive. But let’s look at some of the negative comments that were published in our local Postmedia paper, The Ottawa Citizen: “A library is a thing of the past, anything you need is on the Internet. It’s a big waste of tax dollars.” “People still go to libraries? LOL” “Libraries still exist? Why? Be cheaper to buy everyone a kindle or a smart phone.” “I get everything I need on the Internet. Why not build homes for homeless people and seniors with all that money?” “Library? Why a big place? No one reads books.” It sounds discouraging. But the reality is counterintuitive. Canadian museums attract an impressive 62 million visitors every year. That’s up 10 percent from 2013. The new Halifax Public Library received double the expected number of visitors in its first year in 2015, i.e.: 1.9 million compared with the 900,000 expected. The proposed new Ottawa Public Library is expected to welcome at least 1.5 million visitors every year. The number of visits to public libraries in the U.S. actually increased by 4 percent last year. So, more people than ever are visiting memory institutions. Go figure. Perhaps it explains this interesting quote I found recently about libraries: “beloved in theory, embattled in practice.” Last year, we held a GLAM summit in Ottawa, with the Canadian Museums Association and the Canadian Commission for UNESCO. The meeting’s theme was Taking it to the Streets: Summit on the Value of Libraries, Archives and Museums in a Changing World. Our objective was to deal with the questions of value and relevance I have already mentioned, and also to find new ways to work together. During the Ottawa summit, Maureen Sawa, the CEO of the Greater Victoria Public Library, nailed it on the head when she said that instead of looking at doing more with less, our goal must be to do more with more. More collaborations, more partnerships, more public outreach, more relevance. Because it sums up all of the wonderful possibilities that working together can mean, I think it bears repeating. More with more. As a mantra for the GLAM sector, I like it very much. A good example is the collective called Libraries, Archives and Museums Nova Scotia, formerly known as Libraries Nova Scotia. Although the collective had included members of the archival community for a number of years, it now includes the museum community as well. At a historic joint conference held in 2015, which brought together the Nova Scotia GLAM sector, the organizers included this African proverb:  “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Together, we can help break down the silos that have separated us in the past. Working across the sectors and making use of many disciplines can help us solve the numerous issues that are common to all the GLAM sector. Preservation, conservation, sustainability, and the need to become good advocates for ourselves, to explain our value to the public, not just as individual institutions, but as a cohesive sector. Which brings me to another good example of doing more with more. The British Columbia Library Association recently signed a historic agreement to formalize co-operation among that province’s GLAM sector. To explore, identify, share and consider new ways to work together. I know they have been working hard on this, with the Archives Association of British Columbia and the BC Museums Association, and the work has paid off. British Columbia and Nova Scotia were the first provinces to strike such agreements, and I sincerely hope others will follow suit. *** Now let’s take a closer look at the conclusions of the Ottawa summit. We were treated to many real-life examples of successful innovation in the GLAM community, much of it due to technology. Technology, which allows us to reach our users where they are, which is mostly online. But there are challenges, too. The need to find the resources to acquire the technology, and to hire and train the people who will make the most of it. But it is our lack of experience in locating, attracting and retaining these people, the quote-unquote “talent,” that is creating the greatest bottleneck for innovation in our sector. An additional challenge stems from the fact that the more people use the Web to access our resources, the greater their appetite for visiting our actual physical spaces. Our galleries, our libraries, our archives and our museums. And that’s also why the British Library, in its statement of vision and purpose for 2015 to 2023, pointed out: At a time when the provision of knowledge and culture is increasingly digital and screen-based, the value and importance of high-quality physical spaces and experiences is growing, not diminishing. The more screen-based our lives, it seems, the greater the perceived value of real human encounters and physical artefacts: activity in each realm feeds interest in the other. So we can’t simply “de-invest” our in-person services to invest in the virtual ones. The GLAMs have to do both. Our own DigiLab is a good example of this dual approach, and one I am quite proud of. It’s a hands-on digital lab at 395 Wellington Street that we created to provide free access to scanning equipment and description tools. Researchers now have direct access to high-performance scanners, computers and other tools. In its first few months, DigiLab has enabled over 24,000 pages of textual material and over 1,000 photographs to be digitized and made available to the public. Things like records that track the rain, thunder and lightning over Ottawa in the 19th century… …which contribute to the study of climate change. Photographs that show the Relief Camps established by the Canadian Government to support unemployed labourers at the height of the Great Depression… …to be featured in an upcoming documentary film. Half a century of action in the Logistics Branch of the Canadian Armed Forces. A 100-year-old road trip from Montreal to Vancouver. The legacy of Japanese-Canadian internment camps. These are just some of the fascinating materials that are now accessible through the DigiLab. * * * Technology has also allowed us to continue the dialogue of reconciliation with Canada’s Indigenous peoples. And to provide a bridge between the past and the present, even in the most remote areas of the country. Back in 2001, LAC teamed up with a training program in Nunavut. The idea was to digitize and identify the Inuit peoples and communities seen in historical photos from our collection. Many had remained unidentified for decades. The goal was modest—to digitize and identify 500 photographs within the year. But Project Naming took on a life of its own. Since 2001, we have digitized over 10,000 photographs and it is still going strong. Some 2,500 people and places have been named. Families have been reunited. Identities recovered. And mysteries solved. All of this information, along with the images, is available in our database. And we have expanded the project to include Inuit living in the Northwest Territories, the northern part of the Province of Quebec and the region of Labrador, as well as First Nations and Métis communities in the rest of Canada. Project Naming uses social media technology to help members of Indigenous communities connect with their past. As a result, many of our Indigenous peoples see themselves reflected accurately in the records for the very first time. And if you will allow me, let me give you another example of technology helping with reconciliation. In June of last year, the Manitoba Metis Federation celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Seven Oaks, a battle that marked the emergence of the Métis Nation. To support the anniversary, we introduced software that lets people transcribe authentic historical documents. The first document to go through the process was the Coltman report, written in 1818 by William Coltman. The report provides one of the best sources on the fur-trade war and it’s a key document in the history of the Métis Nation. The entire 521-page handwritten report was transcribed by members of the public in less than a month. A fully searchable PDF is now available in LAC’s database. We just launched a second project—the 91-page diary of Lady Susan Agnes Macdonald, the wife of Sir John A. Macdonald. It’s already been transcribed. Citizen archivists were eager to make a personal connection with history. Of course, I don’t have to convince the museum community that technology has changed our world. Museums and galleries have been at the forefront of technological change from day one. But I want to stress the link between technology and accessibility. For example, the National Heritage Digitization Strategy we have developed, over the past year, as a co-operative initiative by large public libraries, academic libraries and archives, provincial archives, national associations of archivists, librarians, historians and, of course, galleries and museums. The idea is to make accessible, through a single search instrument, all the Canadian material that has been digitized by our combined heritage institutions. The strategy will cover out of copyright, published and unpublished, analogue materials of national, regional and local significance, including: The success of this strategy will depend both on the best use of technology, and on ensuring that access remains the key goal. The degree to which we can reach our users will spell our success or failure. Let’s look at one example from my own backyard. LAC has digitized more than 75 percent of the 640,000 Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) personnel service files from the First World War. By 2018, 16 million pages of the most heavily requested materials we own will be fully accessible on our site. This includes the records and papers of famous soldiers, like Frederick Banting, who discovered insulin, One-Eyed Frank McGee, the legendary hockey player, and Grey Owl, one of the world’s first eco-warriors… as well as little-known soldiers whose families are searching for information about them. This is our biggest mass digitization project to date, but it is also one of our biggest draws. We even have the military records of Wolverine! As it turns out, James Howlett had quite the military career before he met Professor X. And according to our records: he was gravely wounded in action many times and gained a reputation as a gritty survivor. Of course, I’m just kidding. His are not real papers or authentic documents. But using Wolverine’s fake CEF file for our 2016 April Fool’s joke was our most popular social media post ever. We got 157,000 likes on our Facebook page, nearly 24,000 comments, 45,000 shares and in total we reached over 6 million people! We were on TV, we made the front page of Reddit, and in addition to the Canadian media coverage, the story was picked up on Forbes.com and even by Entertainment Weekly. Not bad for an institution supposedly on its way to extinction. And just one of many ways that—thanks to new technologies—GLAMs can attract new audiences and then, once they are hooked, show them what else we have up our sleeves. And while the CEF project is attracting new audiences with the help of technology, the Greater Victoria Public Library is reaching out to new publics in a more traditional way—in person. The library had already established a good working relationship with the Belfry, a local repertory theatre. So when the University of Victoria Librarian suggested they hold their annual lecture series at the Belfry, all three—the public library, the theatre and the university—reaped the benefits. The event was an interview with the acting Librarian of Congress, David Mao by CBC radio personality Shelagh Rogers. By all accounts, not only was it a success, it reached new audiences in a way that could not have happened if the University of Victoria had worked alone. These few examples demonstrate that thinking and working collaboratively can be wildly successful. One of the most pervasive examples of this is Wikipedia. As a historian, I shared the mistrust of many when it was suggested that Wikipedia would be just as reliable as the Encyclopedia Britannica. And if you own a set, you are showing your age! Yet, Wikipedia has become the standard for many people when looking for information. It gets millions of views every day, and it can be read in hundreds of languages. So while museums and other GLAMs have the knowledge and the records, Wikipedia has a reach that none of our institutions could ever match on its own. At LAC, we began a Wikipedia pilot program in January of this year. We are working with Wikimedia Canada, the non-profit body that aims to increase Canadian content in Wikipedia. The idea was that our expanded presence on Wikipedia would attract new users to our website and our collections. LAC now has over 3,000 images embedded on Wikipedia article pages, and in turn this results in roughly 30 million hits a month on LAC materials. And we think we can do even better. Allowing us to Do more with more, if you forgive me for saying it again. For example, as public spaces. Millions of dollars are being invested in libraries, museums and galleries around the world. And it’s not just old folks like me that are using them. According to a new Pew Research Center study, 53 percent of Millennials visited a library at least once in 2016, more than any other generation. According to a young librarian at one of Boston’s public libraries: “One of the biggest values of the library, for all ages, is that it’s a free place where you can be outside of your home and outside of work.” The article points to libraries, but the same applies to all GLAMs. Some think we are being replaced by digital, but in fact, we are offering a valuable complement to it. There is a real need for quality spaces. Here is an example from the world of business that illustrates just how pervasive that need really is. Hudson’s Bay executives were well aware of the fact that online purchasing threatened the future of their brick-and-mortar stores. So they decided to invest in the quality of their spaces, making the “in-store” experience better and more satisfying. And there is a magic to our spaces. I remember when I was the CEO of the Bibliothèque et archives nationales du Québec, in Montreal. During the Red Square movement in 2012, every day, for more than a hundred days, thousands of students marched the streets of Montreal to protest proposed tuition hikes. Buildings were occupied, police cars were set on fire, there were demonstrations and arrests, there was tear gas and violence. The Grande Bibliothèque, Montreal’s central library was right in the heart of it, in the centre of Montreal, located next to one of the universities. Every night we saw the protesters meet in a square across the street from the library, we witnessed the march, heard the shouting of slogans and the wailing of sirens. It was quite scary. But not once did the protesters come in the library. Throughout, it remained a place of safety. Last year I had the privilege of sitting down with the new Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden. During her inaugural speech, she recalled the unrest in Baltimore in April 2015. As she put it: “Cars were still smoldering in the streets. Closed signs were hanging in storefronts for blocks.” Still she made the decision to keep her branch of the Baltimore Public Library open, and she was there, day after day, opening the doors with her staff. Offering a place of sanctuary and understanding. I remember colleagues from the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt telling me similar stories about the library being protected by the students during the so-called Egyptian Revolution of 2011. I think these stories illustrate an important point. GLAMs represent not only safety, but freedom. Freedom to think and to question, to create and, of course, to disagree. This freedom is at the heart of a democratic society. Public spaces can also give people the tools they need to adapt to change. To make our cities and our communities more livable, more welcoming, and more sustainable. That is why, in the spirit of public engagement and partnership, we relocated our Nova Scotia offices. They were in an industrial park in Dartmouth, a little out of the way. We moved them to the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in Halifax last June, so we would be closer to our clients. Not to mention the thousands of clients who visit the museum each year. And in November, I will be in Vancouver to celebrate the move of our staff from another industrial park in Burnaby, British Columbia to the beautiful Vancouver Public Library, built in the heart of Gastown. And in 2018, we’ll be opening up 2,000 square feet of dedicated LAC gallery space at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary to feature some of our portrait collection. The first exhibition will take place between March and December 2018, with the artist self-portrait as its theme. Upcoming themes will include historical and contemporary portraits, as well as a feature exhibition of the portraits of Canadian photographer Roloff Beny. Our work with the Glenbow allows me to raise an interesting point. Technology offers us the chance to “democratize” a great deal of information. But there is still a power to exhibiting authentic objects that exceeds the digital world. My colleague Jack Lohman, the CEO of the Royal BC Museum and member of the working group on the Ottawa Declaration, said: “Access to significant artifacts or to a masterpiece opens a new world, which cannot be experienced in the same way through a mobile phone or a television.” He’s right. Even if the Mona Lisa is merely a click away on Google, millions still line up to see her at the Louvre, live and in person, so to speak. Even if the Beatles music is readily available on iTunes, people line up at the British Library to see the original lyrics of “A Hard Day’s Night” written on the reverse side of Julian Lennon’s birthday card. You, of all people, know that there is an emotion, a visceral response that happens when you come in contact with an original document that nothing can replace. This is a key driver behind our efforts to display our collection at museums and galleries as often and as widely as we can. In total, more than 350 items from LAC’s collection will be out on loan next year. And we’ve complemented all of this with Flickr series, blogs and podcasts, which invite people to discover who we are and access what we have. There are so many possibilities for partnerships, and for new ways to reach our audiences. Unfortunately, many of the new initiatives I mentioned are virtually unknown to the political, economic and media elites, because they spend very little time in GLAMs, those who purchase rather than borrow, and whose economic status means that free services are not really necessary. Cultural consumption for these groups has a very different meaning than it does for most of the Canadian population, yet these are often the people we need to reach to demonstrate our value. And to garner support and financial backing. This is a challenge that we all share. How do we reach them in ways they will appreciate and understand? I think this is yet another challenge we can meet by working side by side, and not in separate camps. In the digital era, you can’t simply reduce their role to the functions of collecting and preserving works downstream from the creative act. GLAMs are present at the very beginning of the creative chain, providing inspiration and material to artists of all disciplines—not just authors and poets, but also digital artists, musicians, painters, directors. This is a little-heralded role of the GLAMs, which are often seen as being simply the final resting places for finished creative work. The graveyard, rather than the maternity ward, if you’ll forgive me that metaphor. Even I was surprised to learn just how much artists and creators rely on us. We created a Twitter hashtag known as LAC Muse to let artists tell us how they have used our collections to realize their creative projects, and the results have been remarkable. One of the liveliest presenters at the summit was Derek Kwan, an actor and creator from Vancouver. His documentary film, Taste of Identity, was made with the help of the resources available at the Vancouver Public Library’s Inspiration Lab. Derek was quick to point out that his film could not have been made without the Inspiration Lab. It gave him the space to collaborate, access to state-of-the-art equipment and, of course, inspiration. It won Best Canadian Short and Best Documentary at the 2015 Canada Shorts Film Festival. As a result of its success, he was one of 15 filmmakers from across Canada invited to be part of a CBC development workshop. Derek’s enthusiasm was echoed by another young artist—Eric Chan, a digital artist known as eepmon, who fuses computer code and drawing to portray his artistic vision. He spoke at length about how the GLAMs can be creative mediums in and of themselves. Here is an example of his wearable art—an exclusive Canada Goose parka that combines fine arts, design and computer programming. There are numerous other examples at LAC—examples that show how raw material from our collection takes on a second life through the creative interpretation of artists from all disciplines. Take Jane Urquhart, who researched the sculptor of the Vimy Ridge Memorial for her classic work of fiction The Stone Carvers. Or Frances Itani, who spent six months in the library and archives researching a novel called Deafening, which went on to be published in 16 countries. She spent an entire week in our building listening to recordings of songs from the First World War, conjuring up the times in a way only music can. Jeff Thomas is an Iroquois artist and photographer who was so inspired by seeing the famous portraits of the “Four Indian Kings” from our collection, he went on to develop an entire series of his own unique works of art, called “Red Robe.” I am especially proud of the work of artist Sarah Hatton, who works at LAC. She took hundreds of brass fasteners—all removed by hand from the service files of the Canadian soldiers who served in the First World War—and created a unique and moving installation called Detachment. Detachment is a series of star charts showing how the night sky would have looked over the sites of several major battles in that war, including Vimy and Passchendaele. I wish we had time to discuss more examples. But it’s clear—GLAMs are sources of inspiration, places where connections can be made, where collaboration can take place, where history can be understood and where the future can be imagined. We are definitely part of the “creative ecosystem.” And if you’ll allow me to digress for a minute, I’ll say that this is in step with Minister Mélanie Joly’s vision for a Creative Canada. You will remember that Canadian Heritage held public consultations over the last 18 months on how to strengthen Canadian content in a digital world. As the result of this consultation, a policy framework for creative and cultural industries was developed by the department and was shared widely on September 28. This policy framework is based on three pillars: Arguably, the GLAM sector is part of all three pillars. But I think pillar one is best aligned with the principles of the Ottawa Declaration. If we invest in creators so they can come up with the best ideas, enabling them to conquer domestic and foreign markets, GLAMs and the power they have to inspire must be seen as part of this very first pillar. We provide access, we showcase diversity, we promote collaboration, and we support innovation. So let’s make sure this message is articulated and heard! Now, getting back to the summit. At the end of our discussions, we collectively adopted the Ottawa Declaration. The Declaration is a commitment to moving forward. Based on a shared recognition of how much we have in common, and how great it would be to work together. Just to refresh your memory, we agreed to the following: Increase collaboration between our institutions to catalyze new partnerships that spark creativity and enhance engagement; Develop innovative programs and services to empower us to engage our publics; and Enrich and expand access to our collections to ensure we contribute significantly to the public good and sustainable development. Leaving the summit, we knew that we needed to keep the momentum going. So, we created a working group to put the Ottawa Declaration into action. It is co-chaired by myself and John McAvity, the Executive Director of the CMA, who needs no introduction! Our six members, with expertise from across the GLAM sector, have a mandate to flesh out the vision of the Ottawa Declaration. Paul Gilbert, Jack Lohman and Chris Kitzan are from museums and galleries. Christine Lovelace is an archivist at the University of New Brunswick. Loubna Ghaouti is head librarian at Laval University in Quebec. And Maureen Sawa, from the Greater Victoria Public Library. Our mandate is to explore and study how GLAMs bring value to Canadian society. And to take an active role in identifying areas where partnerships could be developed. Let’s see where we’re at, 10 months after the summit. Which reminds me of a quote from Oscar Wilde. He described a cynic as someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. But we do need to prove our value and to do it efficiently. Of course, there have been studies on the value of libraries in the recent past. For instance, it has been estimated that for every £1 of public funding the British Library receives, £4.90 is generated for the United Kingdom’s economy. This 5 to 1 ratio is similar in Canada, according to recent studies done for the Toronto Public Libraries and the Ottawa Public Libraries. But—to the best of the collective knowledge of the working group—there has never been a study on the value of the whole GLAM sector. So we are working on scoping out what such a study should look like so that we encompass the reality of all types of memory institutions. We started the work by developing an inventory of examples where institutions from the GLAM sector have successfully engaged with organizations outside the sector, for instance performing arts institutions. The Canadian Urban Libraries Council had surveyed its members on this very subject last summer, so we are using their results to expand and include museums, galleries and archives. Our goal is to explore the gaps and potential need for a national cultural policy in which the GLAMs would play a key role. We found that all five countries strive to increase: In each of the five countries we surveyed, there are driving factors that influence their approach to policy development, and they include collaboration, inclusion and access. These concepts were also echoed in the Ontario Museum Association’s 2025 Strategic Vision and Action Plan, as well as Ontario’s Culture Strategy. I mention them here because both documents contain a strong commitment to being inclusive, and to serving diverse communities, qualities that were found in our environmental scan and that we also emphasized during the December summit. Both documents support creativity and innovation, as well as partnership and collaboration in education as well as in the government, not-for-profit and private sectors. And they both highlight the need to demonstrate the social and the economic value of culture and cultural organizations, and their key role in the creative economy. So, if great minds think alike, I dare say we’re on the right track. On January 30, 2018, we are holding a second GLAM summit at the Royal Ontario Museum. We have decided to focus on four topics that will act as drivers as we move forward: We are looking for input on possible speakers, especially to present the point of view of our partners outside the GLAM sector (the private and not-for-profit sectors, communities, government and Indigenous peoples). I hope many of you will be able to join us in Toronto and join the Ottawa Declaration movement. Let’s work together so all of us, individually and collectively, can do more with more. Thank you.\n",

      "News Release Text: Canada’s non-hydro renewable power capacity grew by more than eight per cent in 2016, adding nearly 1,300 megawatts (MW) of solar, biomass and wind-generated power, according to the National Energy Board’s (NEB) 2017 update of the Canada’s Renewable Power Landscape 2017 report. In 2016, Canada’s electricity generation was 66 per cent renewable, with non-hydro renewables accounting for 7.2 per cent and hydro accounting for 58.8 per cent. When nuclear power generation is added, a total of 80.6 per cent of Canada’s electricity was non-emitting in terms of greenhouse gases. The long term trend in Canada since 2005 has been increased power generation from natural gas and wind, and decreased generation from coal. In 2016, total Canadian natural gas-fired power generation actually dropped due to decreases in British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador. However, in Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, natural gas generation increased as part of these provinces’ ongoing transition away from coal. The NEB monitors energy markets and assesses Canadian energy requirements and trends to support its regulatory responsibilities. This report is part of a series of publications on energy supply, demand, and infrastructure that the NEB publishes regularly as part of its ongoing market monitoring. The National Energy Board is an independent federal regulator of several parts of Canada’s energy industry. It regulates pipelines, energy development and trade in the public interest with safety as its primary concern.

The path behind us has been marked by many generations of social and political structures that neglected and discriminated against Indigenous peoples. Yet, First Nations, Inuit and Métis persevered, demonstrating the resilience and dignity of first peoples in Canada. The way forward includes ensuring that Indigenous peoples have the opportunities, space, and respect they deserve, in order to heal spirits, revitalize cultures, and exercise rights.The Government of Canada is steadfast in its commitment to work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples to achieve these goals. This past year has seen the creation of our two new departments, which aligns with recommendations made twenty years ago by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, calling for one department to focus on delivering services, and another focused on building and maintaining the Crown-Indigenous relationship. We look forward to the day when Indigenous Services and programs will be determined by Indigenous-led institutions and governments.  We’re proud of the great strides that have been made and also recognize that much work lies ahead. This is an exciting time – full of challenges and also full of promise.Moving forward on this important journey, we invite each and every one of you to take time to participate in one of the many celebrations organized across the country; and, to ask yourself how you as an individual, family and community member can contribute to the journey of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in this country.We wish you a happy National Indigenous Peoples Day.”For more information, media may contact:James Fitz-MorrisDirector of Communications and Issues ManagementOffice of the Honourable Carolyn Bennett819-997-0002Media RelationsCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada819-953-1160Rachel RappaportPress SecretaryOffice of the Honourable Jane PhilpottMinister of Indigenous Services819-934-2796Media RelationsIndigenous Services Canada819-953-1160Join the conversation about Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada:Twitter: Minister Carolyn BennettFacebook: Minister Carolyn BennettJoin the conversation about services for First Nations, Inuit and Métis:Twitter: Minister Jane PhilpottFacebook: GovCan – Indigenous Peoples\n",

We know that one day alone cannot express the innumerable contributions of Indigenous Peoples and communities around the world, but we hope that all Canadians take this opportunity to reflect and celebrate these achievements. 2019 marks the International Year of Indigenous Languages. It is also the theme of this year’s International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples. According to UNESCO, three-quarters of the 90 Indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered. As language is essential to Indigenous Peoples’ identity and culture, the Government of Canada recognizes it must act with urgency, along with Indigenous Peoples, to reverse that trend.  We reached a major milestone this year towards reclaiming, revitalizing, maintaining and strengthening Indigenous languages as the Indigenous Languages Act was granted Royal Assent. This represents an important step on the path to reconciliation. Together with Indigenous Peoples, we are working hard to ensure that Indigenous languages can flourish across the country. Unfortunately, too many Canadians still do not know the histories and contributions of Indigenous peoples. There is much to learn, and today provides a real opportunity for all to listen and understand how Indigenous Peoples have helped shape our world. Now, as we embark on a new path, we are acknowledging the wrongs of the past and looking towards Indigenous Peoples and communities to help shape the world of tomorrow. In Canada, we are seeing the profound impact that strong and productive collaboration with Indigenous Peoples – based on the recognition of rights, respect and partnership – can have. Every day, the Government of Canada continues to collaborate with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners across the country through negotiation and dialogue to co-develop agreements that advance reconciliation and address community priorities, including governance, education, language, closing socio-economic gaps, and addressing historical wrongs. Today marks an opportunity for us all to commit to reconciliation, regardless of our background and to be guided by the standards set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Together, we can truly make reconciliation an action, and not just a concept.  We wish all of you a memorable International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples.”\n",

      "News Release Text:  On this International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) is launching a second phase of consultations on regulatory reform in the area of accessible transportation. These consultations will focus on: The CTA is interested in broad input from its Accessibility Advisory Committee, disability community organizations, the transportation industry, and members of the public. Any interested party can consult the CTA's consultation paper and provide written submissions by email at consultations@otc-cta.gc.ca until February 7, 2020. All submissions will be considered public documents and will be posted on the CTA's website unless a party asks the CTA not to release certain confidential information. More detailed information on submissions is available in the consultation paper. The proposed regulations will be drafted and pre-published in Canada Gazette I after the consultations have been completed and all input has been considered. There will be an opportunity to review and comment on draft regulations before they are finalized, approved by the CTA and Cabinet, and published in Canada Gazette II. The goal is to have regulations in place by summer 2021. Quote “The first phase of ATPDR development helped advance our vision of making Canada's national transportation system the most accessible in the world. We are now moving forward with phase II, and look forward to receiving input from a wide range of stakeholders, experts, and interested Canadians. Together, we can help ensure that the fundamental right of persons with disabilities to accessible transportation is realized in practice.” Scott Streiner, Chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency Background On July 10, 2019, the CTA announced that the first phase of regulatory reform in the area of accessible transportation, the new ATPDR, was finalized. The CTA consolidated its various accessibility instruments – six voluntary codes and two regulations – to create a single, robust, legally binding set of accessible transportation regulations. The ATPDR establish legally binding requirements for transportation services, technical standards for equipment, communications, training, and security and border screening. Most provisions of the regulations will come into effect on June 25, 2020. A number of outstanding accessibility-related issues will be considered through this second phase of consultations and regulatory development.  About the Agency  The Canadian Transportation Agency is an independent, quasi-judicial tribunal and regulator that has, with respect to all matters necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, all the powers of a superior court. The CTA has three core mandates: helping to keep the national transportation system running efficiently and smoothly, protecting the fundamental right of persons with disabilities to accessible transportation services, and providing consumer protection for air passengers. To help advance these mandates, the CTA makes and enforces ground rules that establish the rights and responsibilities of transportation service providers and users and level the playing field among competitors, resolves disputes using a range of tools from facilitation and mediation to arbitration and adjudication, and ensures that transportation providers and users are aware of their rights and responsibilities and how the CTA can help them.

      "News Release Text: The new Industrial Design Regulations (the Regulations), were drafted to facilitate Canada's accession to the Hague Agreement and to carry out the amendments that were made to the Industrial Design Act. In addition, the new Regulations also modernize Canada's industrial design regime by updating, codifying and improving aspects of the regulatory framework. The Regulations were developed in close collaboration with stakeholders, including initial consultations on the drafting instructions in 2016, public web-based consultations on an early draft of the Regulations in the summer of 2017, and public consultation through the Canada Gazette, Part I, between December 2017 and January 2018. The following substantive changes were made to the Regulations after the consultation period: The Canadian Intellectual Property Office would like to thank everyone who participated in the consultations and contributed to finalizing these Regulations. The following provides a technical summary of the changes to the Regulations: This section was drafted to define all relevant terminology necessary to carry into effect the Geneva Act (1999) of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs (the Hague Agreement). Definitions have been added for Hague terms, e.g., \"Common Regulations\", \"date of registration\", \"Hague Agreement\" and for national terms, e.g., \"divisional application\", \"the Office\". The following definitions were removed as they were found to be no longer relevant: \"applicant\", \"agent\", \"registered proprietor\" and \"representative for service\". This part contains provisions that apply to both national and Hague applications, unless otherwise specified. These provisions provide applicants and the Industrial Design Office with more flexibility in the manner of communication and reduce the burden on clients (such as applicants or agents). New provisions will enable electronic communications. These communications will be deemed to have been received on their actual date of receipt, whether CIPO is open to the public or not. If applicants consent to receiving electronic communications, they will only receive communications through the specific electronic means they choose. Going forward, documents, information and fees must be addressed to the \"Industrial Design Office\". Previously, all correspondence had to relate to only one application or one registered design, with few exceptions. Moving forward, the new Regulations removed this restriction. The Communications sections also provide new detail on acceptable means of communications, the receipt of documents and designated establishments. The provisions outline the manner of presenting documents and provide the Minister or Commissioner with authority to accept a different form of documents. Consequently, reference to the Canadian Patent Office Record has been removed. Similar to the previous Regulations, communications made with the intent of protesting the registration of a design will be acknowledged and no information will be given as to the action taken. However, the new Regulations contain a new provision indicating that these communications will be made available to the public once the application is made available to the public. This section provides greater flexibility for appointing an agent and clarifies what action can be undertaken by the applicant or an authorized third party independently of that agent. These provisions would allow for the appointment of an agent provided that the Industrial Design Office receives a notice of appointment with the postal address of the agent. There is no requirement that an appointed agent have a Canadian address. The previous requirement to have a representative for service, in the case of foreign applicants, has been removed. If an agent is appointed, that agent must represent the applicant. As an exception to this provision, a person may act on their own behalf or be represented by any person authorized by them, even if they appointed an agent, for the purpose of: filing an application, paying a fee, requesting a late maintenance or requesting a transfer and providing evidence of such transfer if required. Following publication in the Canada Gazette, Part I, an additional exception was added for giving notice of the appointment or revocation of an agent on the file. The applicant or an authorized third party may revoke an agent, or the agent may revoke him/herself by sending the Industrial Design Office a notice to that effect. This section clarifies the content of the Register of Industrial Designs (the Register). The content of the Register was undefined in the previous Regulations. This section was introduced to specify the Register's contents (e.g., registration date, name and address of the registered proprietor, particulars of any transfers, etc.). For a complete list, please refer to the Regulations. The Industrial Design Office will no longer issue a certificate of registration. Instead, applicants will receive a notification when their design is registered. While the Regulations do not specify the contents of the registration documents, the Industrial Design Office intends to send out a Notice of Industrial Design Registration, a Registration Details Report, the representation of the design and maintenance information. This section aligns application requirements with international standards, including those of the Hague System. The new Regulations provide more flexibility for applicants in drafting their application. A number of new application requirements have been introduced, such as: This section also contains provisions for divisional applications. The previous Regulations indicated that an application must relate to only one design or to variants. While this is still the case, the ability to file divisional applications has been extended to content that was not only applied for in the original application, but for anything that was disclosed (e.g., other designs that are contained within a larger environmental view) in that application on its filing date. Applicants will have up to two years to file a divisional application for anything that was disclosed to the Industrial Design Office through an original application, except if an application has to be divided following a request from the Industrial Design Office. In that case, the new Regulations provide an exception where an original application may be divided even though the two-year period has ended. A divisional application will continue to be considered a separate application with respect to the payment of any fees. Filing date requirements have been simplified and aligned with international standards, including those of the Hague System. This will allow applicants to quickly secure a filing date and proceed to the next step in the process. A description and a title are no longer required to secure a filing date. The filing date of an application other than a divisional application or a Hague application is the day CIPO receives all of the following: If the application does not contain all the required information, the Industrial Design Office will try to notify the applicant (i.e., if identity and contact information have been provided); they will have two months to submit the missing information. Previously applicants had three months to submit the missing information. Divisional applications inherit the filing date of the original application from which the divisional derives. An addition was made for Hague applications, whose filing date is the date of registration of the corresponding international registration. This new section codifies certain Office actions throughout the examination of a file, whether it is a national or Hague application. It also carries forward provisions contained in the Industrial Design Act. The new Industrial Design Act specifies that the Minister must examine, in accordance with the Regulations, each application and determine if the design is registrable. The new Regulations stipulate that, if the design is not registrable, the Industrial Design Office will send a report outlining its objections. Applicants will have three months to reply to the report. Currently, an applicant may request a six-month extension of time to respond to this report â€” with a possible subsequent extension of another six months depending on the circumstances. Under the new Regulations, only one extension of six months, per report, can be requested. If the Industrial Design Office does not receive a response, the application will be abandoned. An abandoned application may be reinstated within six months of the abandonment by replying to the outstanding report and paying the appropriate fee. The same registrability criteria will apply to a Hague application. If the design is not registrable, the Industrial Design Office will send a report outlining its objections to the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in the form of a \"notification of refusal\". The International Bureau will then send a copy of the notification of refusal to the applicant. Any reply, or subsequent amendment to the application, or other communication on the file will occur directly between the applicant and the Industrial Design Office. The new Regulations codify an existing practice by introducing a new provision on advanced examination. On payment of a fee, applicants may request advanced examination of a file; this has the effect of moving the application out of the routine \"first-in, first-out\" order. The new Regulations also codify the process for requesting a delay in the registration of a design. A request for delay of registration can be made at any time before registration, provided that the Industrial Design Office has enough time to implement the delay. This is similar to existing practice, but introduces a limit to the delay of registration, which can only be delayed until the day that is 30 months after the filing date of the application or, if a request for priority was made, 30 months after the earliest filing date of the previously regularly filed application on which the request for priority is based. On request and payment of the fee, the Industrial Design Office will, if technically feasible, delay the registration until the end of that time period. A delay of registration cannot be requested for a design that is the subject of a Hague application. This section clarifies ambiguities regarding how and when amendments may be submitted to the Industrial Design Office. The current practice of allowing an application to be amended before the design is registered will continue, with some limitations. Under the new Regulations, an application generally must not be amended to: In addition, an application must not be amended if it has been made available to the public and the amendment changes the name of the finished article to the name of a substantially different finished article. This section clarifies and codifies procedures for priority requests for national applications. Requirements for priority requests for Hague applications are outlined in Section 45 (Priority). A request for priority must be made in the application or in a separate document. Requirements include the filing date and the name of the country or office of filing. While not mandatory, the Industrial Design Office suggests applicants also include the number of the previous regularly filed application(s). A priority request must be made no later than the earlier of six months after the earliest filing date in that priority request and the date of registration of the application. A new provision was introduced stipulating that a request for priority may be withdrawn before the design is registered. If it is withdrawn more than two months before the date on which the application is to be made public, the publication date will be recalculated without taking into account that priority request. New requirements for correcting errors in a priority claim, providing certified copies and translations of priority documents are also outlined in these sections. An important change is the addition of a consequence for applicants requesting priority if they do not comply with a request from the Industrial Design Office to provide or make available a copy of their priority documentation. The draft Regulations that were published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, proposed that the request for priority would be deemed not to have been made. After publication in the Canada Gazette, Part I, this provision was clarified to specify that, in these cases, the request for priority will be deemed to have been withdrawn instead. This means that the Industrial Design Office will remove the applicant's priority request in cases of non-compliance and that the priority claim will, in effect, be withdrawn from a file as of a specific date. This section is new and provides additional certainty for applicants on relevant prior art. Currently, when the same applicant submits similar designs on different dates, the registration of the earlier filed design will block registration of the later filed design for lack of novelty. The new Regulations contain a provision indicating that if the filing date of the later filed application is no later than 12 months after the filing date of the earlier filed application, the design in the earlier filed application will not be considered in the prior art. This will allow applicants to seek protection on similar designs if they are filed within 12 months of one another. This section identifies the prescribed date for making an application available to the public and clarifies the effect of a withdrawal of a request for priority on the prescribed date. Currently, an application is only made available to the public once the design is registered. Under the new Regulations, a national application will be made available to the public on the earlier of registration of the design or 30 months from the earliest priority date or, if there is no priority claim, 30 months from the Canadian filing date. The 30-month outer limit is established in the Industrial Design Act. In the unlikely case where prosecution takes more than 30 months, an application would be made available to the public prior to registration of the design. Applicants wishing to ensure that registration of their designs occurs before their application is made available to the public are encouraged to respond promptly to any office actions. Note that if a document provided to the Industrial Design Office relates to more than one application or registration, the document will be made available to the public at the earliest date that an application or registration to which that document relates is made available to the public. Hague applications will be made available to the public when they are published in the International Designs Bulletin, which is the official publication of the Hague System and is managed by the International Bureau. If a request for priority is withdrawn at least two months before the scheduled date for making the application available to the public, that date will be recalculated without taking into account the withdrawn priority request. If an application is withdrawn at least two months before the date on which it must be made available to the public, the application and any related documents will not be made available to the public. This section provides additional clarity for applicants and specifies the period of exclusive right for which maintenance fees must be paid. The current Regulations stipulate that, before five years from the registration date, the proprietor of a design must pay a maintenance fee in order to extend the duration of the exclusive right for another five years. The new Regulations maintain this process; however, instead of being renewed for five years, a renewed registration will cover a period that begins five years after the date of registration and ends on the later of the end of 10 years after the date of registration and the end of 15 years after the filing date of the application (the maximum term of protection was extended from 10 years to 15 years in the new Industrial Design Act). The current Regulations provide a six-month grace period if an applicant misses the deadline to pay the maintenance fee. The new Regulations will maintain the current late maintenance process, with the six-month grace period after the five-year deadline, and the applicable late fee. The procedure for maintaining international registrations will be administered by WIPO. These sections simplify procedures for transferring ownership and registering name changes. Transfer - The new Regulations update terminology, replacing the term \"Assignments\" (in the current Regulations) with the term \"Transfers\", which is more aligned with international nomenclature. In addition, the Industrial Design Office will no longer require assignment documents. A request to record or register a transfer must be accompanied by the required fee and include the name and address of the transferee. The current fee will continue to apply. Changes of name or address - The new Regulations codify the current practice to change the name or address of a registered proprietor: the Industrial Design Office will register the change on request from the registered proprietor. No fee will apply for this service. This section clarifies the days when deadlines will be extended. The new Regulations introduce a provision to clarify existing practice regarding holidays and closures. If a deadline is to fall on one of the days prescribed by the new Regulations (e.g., Canada Day), it will be extended to the next day on which CIPO is open to the public. This list of days will be common across CIPO's other lines of business. These sections clarify fee and refund procedures. The fees for each service will remain the same. A new provision has been introduced to require that a request for a refund be made within three years of the date on which the fee was paid. The new Regulations also provide the Minister with flexibility to waive fees if circumstances warrant. This part contains new provisions that will apply only to Hague applications or Hague registrations and excludes certain sections of the Industrial Design Act from applying. The following sections are all new requirements necessary to implement the Hague Agreement. These provisions were drafted with the goal of minimizing differences in format, content and treatment of a national industrial design application and one received through the Hague System. The Industrial Design Office intends to treat both types of applications equally (e.g., first-in, first-out processing). Hague registrations are recorded in the International Register (not in the Canadian Register). The International Register and items contained in an international registration are evidence of their contents. A copy certified by the International Bureau is evidence of the particulars of the recording or item and is admissible in any court. Hague registrations will not be republished in the Canadian online industrial design database. Searches of the Canadian database will include Hague registrations and the search results will link to WIPO's Hague Express database, which includes international registrations that designate Canada. Each design in an international registration will be deemed to be a Hague application, filed in accordance with the Industrial Design Act. As such, the name of the product indicated in the international registration will be considered the name of the finished article required under Canadian legislation. The Industrial Design Office will also consider the representation of the design contained in the international registration as the representation for a Hague application. The holder of the international registration is considered to be the applicant in respect of a Hague application. WIPO will collect and manage fees. If an international registration is cancelled, renounced or limited in respect of Canada, the corresponding Hague application(s) will be considered to have been withdrawn. Specific provisions of the Industrial Design Act respecting filing date will not apply to Hague applications. Rather, a Hague application's filing date will be the date of registration of the corresponding international registration. This provision outlines that the Industrial Design Office must not refuse to register a Hague application without first sending the International Bureau a notification of refusal (essentially equivalent to an examiner's first report) within 12 months of the international registration's publication date. If a notification of refusal is not sent within this timeframe, the design will be deemed registered. Industrial Design Act provisions respecting the registration of a design will not apply to a Hague application. Instead, if the Industrial Design Office is satisfied that a design in an Hague application is registrable, it will send a statement of grant of protection to the International Bureau and the design will be deemed registered in Canada. The date of registration of the design is the date of the statement. If the Industrial Design Office does not send a notification of refusal within 12 months from the date of publication in the International Register, the design will also be deemed to be registered. In that case, the date of registration of the design will be the first day after the end of that period. In both cases, the holder of the international registration will be deemed the registered proprietor of the design. If an international registration is renounced or limited in respect of Canada, the corresponding Hague registration will be considered to have been canceled. WIPO will handle a request for priority in a Hague application. If WIPO approves the priority request, the Industrial Design Office will consider it to comply with Canadian requirements. Corrections to the priority claim must be directed to WIPO. Some sections of the Industrial Design Act will not apply to Hague applications, as international registrations will be made available to the public by the International Bureau. The Industrial Design Office will allow for a deferment of publication of up to 30 months for an international registration designating Canada. Any international registration sent in confidence to the Industrial Design Office by WIPO will not be made available to the public. The term of protection for Hague Registration will begin on the date of registration of the design and end on the later of the end of 10 years after the date of registration of the design and the end of 15 years after the filing date of the corresponding Hague application. The term will also end if the international registration expires in respect of Canada. The International Bureau administers renewals; fees must be paid directly to the International Bureau within five years from the international registration date. The International Bureau will administer requests for transfers. This section will include a provision allowing the Industrial Design Office to act as the competent authority to issue an attestation of transfer in cases where the apparent transferee cannot obtain the signature of the holder of the international registration and that holder is a Canadian national. This provision will exclude the Industrial Design Act from application and will outline that the Industrial Design Office's final refusal may be appealed to the Federal Court within two months of the day on which the notice is sent. If the refusal is reversed, the Industrial Design Office will send a statement of grant of protection to WIPO. If a Hague registration is invalidated, the Industrial Design Office will notify WIPO in order for the invalidation to be recorded in the International Register in respect of Canada. These provisions will allow the Industrial Design Office to process a correction (e.g., for technical or clerical errors) to an international registration. The Industrial Design Office will also have the flexibility to refuse the effects of a correction. If the period to issue a refusal on a Hague application or to issue a refusal of the effects of a correction expires on a day on which the International Bureau or CIPO is closed, it will be extended to the next day the International Bureau or CIPO is open to the public. Transitional Provisions - Transitional provisions carry forward those established in the Industrial Design Act. For applications filed prior to the coming into force date, some sections of the new Regulations will not apply because the former Regulations will continue to be in effect for those previously filed applications. Table 1 identifies the sections of the new Regulations that would not apply, as well as the corresponding requirements that will continue from the former Regulations. Provisions in the new Regulations that would apply to applications filed prior to the coming into force date are outlined at the bottom of Table 1. For an application received before the coming into force date, but for which a filing date cannot be established under the former Industrial Design Act, the application will be deemed never to have been filed. It will need to be filed again, under the new Industrial Design Act and the new Regulations. For applications received after the coming into force date, the new Industrial Design Act and Regulations will apply. Repeal - The new Regulations will repeal and replace the former Regulations. Coming into Force - The new Regulations will come into force at the same time as the amended Industrial Design Act, on November 5, 2018. The tariff of fees has been updated to reflect terminology for transfers (removing reference to assignment documents). The fees for each service will remain the same.\n",

      "News Release Text: Over the past months, many Quebec residents have worked from home, taken classes, and kept in contact with their friends and family through the Internet. The global COVID-19 pandemic has made it more important than ever that everyone has access fast and reliable Internet, no matter where they live. Today, the Government’s Quebec Lieutenant, the Honourable Pablo Rodriguez, highlighted the launch of the Universal Broadband Fund. This investment of $1.75 billion will help connect the regions of Quebec to high-speed Internet, faster. Originally announced in Budget 2019 as a $1 billion program, the Government is now providing additional funding to advance large, high-impact projects, which will leverage partnerships including with the Canada Infrastructure Bank broadband initiative. The program will include a $150 million Rapid Response Stream with an accelerated application process for projects that will allow shovel-ready projects that can be completed in the next year. The UBF will also allocate $50 million of its total budget for mobile Internet projects that primarily benefit Indigenous peoples. This investment will help connect 98 per cent of Canadians across the country to high-speed Internet by 2026 so that they can better participate in the digital economy. The Quebec Lieutenant, Mr. Rodriguez also highlighted an agreement of $600 million with Canadian satellite company Telesat to secure low-earth-orbit satellite capacity, which will improve connectivity and expand high-speed Internet coverage to rural and remote regions across Canada. Today’s investments will help make progress on the Government of Canada’s commitment to create over one million jobs, and its work to support Canadians living in rural, remote, and northern communities. As we take steps toward our economic recovery from the pandemic, the Government of Canada will continue to make investments in infrastructure to build strong communities and a more competitive and resilient Canada for everyone. The Government has already made significant progress toward the goal of connecting Canadians to high-speed internet. In Quebec, the Government of Canada has invested a total of $213,685,648 in 54 projects, which will connect 250,293 households.\n",

      "News Release Text: The Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport, issued this statement today to mark International Civil Aviation Day: “As Canada’s Minister of Transport, it is my pleasure to mark International Civil Aviation Day. International civil aviation brings people together from all corners of the globe. Today, we celebrate our strong collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and our other global aviation partners. “As a founding member and leading contributor to ICAO, Canada has been the proud host country for more than seven decades, and we are fully committed to its success. We value our longstanding relationship with ICAO and are honoured to host it in Montréal, the world’s civil aviation capital. “International Civil Aviation Day was established in 1994, as a part of ICAO’s 50th anniversary, to promote the global socio-economic benefits of international civil aviation. Twenty-five years later, we take this opportunity every year to celebrate our collective accomplishments and look forward to the future. “The theme for International Civil Aviation Day in 2019 is 75 Years of Connecting the World. As we mark ICAO’s historic 75th anniversary, we can look back at some of our joint achievements this year. “This fall, Canada hosted the 40th Session of the ICAO Assembly in Montréal, Québec. We welcomed over 2,400 delegates to define ICAO priorities for the next three years, in support of safe, secure, efficient, and environmentally sustainable growth in global aviation. As part of ICAO’s Next Generation of Aviation Professionals initiative, we have also been working with Canadian aviation industry members to address the aviation labour shortage, and are working with under-represented groups and Indigenous communities to promote careers in aviation. “As we approach a new decade in 2020, we will continue working closely and innovatively with our global aviation partners to advance civil aviation in Canada and around the world.”\n",

      "News Release Text: On 23 January 2019, a de Havilland DHC-8-102 operated by Air Creebec Inc. was conducting a flight from Rouyn-Noranda to Montréal, Quebec, with 3 crew members and 6 passengers on board. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft began to veer to the left and continued to do so until the aircraft rolled off the surface of the runway. When the pilot flying aborted the takeoff, full power was inadvertently added to the right engine, accentuating the deviation. The aircraft came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One passenger received minor injuries and the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The investigation found that the pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway. The pilot monitoring was carrying out other tasks and was not looking out the window to monitor the aircraft’s path. Consequently, he did not notice the aircraft’s deviation and was unable to help the pilot flying correct it. One of the two pilots had significantly more experience than the other, creating a strong authority gradient that reduced flight crew cohesion and thus the effectiveness of their monitoring of the aircraft during the takeoff roll. The investigation also found that if pilots do not carry out a pre-takeoff briefing, they may not have a shared mental model of the actions that must be taken during the takeoff, increasing the risk of an accident. As well, if the roles and responsibilities of the pilot flying and pilot monitoring are not well defined, monitoring may not be effective, increasing the risk that an aircraft’s deviation from its path may fail to be detected and corrected. See the investigation page for more information. The TSB is an independent agency that investigates air, marine, pipeline, and rail transportation occurrences. Its sole aim is the advancement of transportation safety. It is not the function of the Board to assign fault or determine civil or criminal liability.\n",

This funding through the AgriCompetitiveness program will also facilitate a series of initiatives that promote farm safety for producers, their families, and workers. Activities include awareness raising, community engagement, and the development and maintenance of safety resources and tools to address existing and emerging safety needs at the provincial and national level. In addition to outreach and awareness activities, CASA will continue to provide farm safety learning opportunities to rural emergency responders and firefighters, and provide online health and safety training courses to farm workers. The theme for this year’s Canadian Agricultural Safety Week (CASW) is “Lead an AgSafe Canada”. From March 14 to March 20, 2021, CASA will showcase farm safety initiatives and programs across Canada. In addition to this annual event, CASA will continue to provide essential training and tools to farmers and stakeholders relating to existing and emerging safety concerns at the farm level. Farm safety is crucial to the overall health and wellbeing of Canada’s farmers. Ensuring farmers have access to tools to protect both their mental and physical health is key to the strength and prosperity of the agriculture sector.\n",

      "News Release Text: Climate change is a global crisis that affects us all, but not all equally. Developing countries are issuing urgent calls for help in combating the worst impacts for which they are the least prepared. Helping the poorest and most vulnerable countries is a top priority for Canada and the Egyptian COP27 presidency. Today, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, on behalf of the Honourable Harjit S. Sajjan, Minister of International Development and Minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada, announced a number of practical initiatives totaling $24 million that respond directly to the needs and priorities of developing countries. The projects, funded through Canada’s $5.3 billion International Climate Finance Commitment, directly respond to the needs and priorities of developing countries in three critical areas: loss and damage, access to climate finance, and climate governance: Loss and damage Access to climate finance Climate governance In 2021, Canada doubled its climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over five years (2021–2026). This commitment more than doubles the provision of funding toward adaptation to a minimum of forty percent, which is in line with the objectives set by the Glasgow Pact.  Last month, at the behest of the international community, Canada and Germany released the Climate Finance Delivery Plan Progress Report, highlighting what developed countries have been doing this year to deliver on the collective US$100 billion goal. The report reaffirmed a commitment to transparency, and clearly detailed where more work is needed. Canada remains steadfast in its commitment to work with others to reach the US$100 billion goal as soon as possible and through 2025. Across its climate finance contributions, Canada continues to help developing countries better address climate change and adapt to its impacts. Over the next five years, Canada will focus its international climate finance on four main thematic areas: clean energy transition and coal phase-out, climate-smart agriculture and food systems, nature-based solutions and biodiversity, and climate governance.\n",

Ensuring the Canadian Coast Guard has the equipment it needs to lead the response to marine pollution incidents in Canadian waters is an essential part of this Plan. Today, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, was in Victoria, B.C. to announce the first delivery of new marine environmental response equipment for the Coast Guard’s Western Regional Headquarters. The new equipment includes curtain boom, which forms a temporary barrier to contain an oil spill, making the recovery of a spill easier and helping reduce the spread of oil, and medium-sized portable skimmers, which are used to collect, separate and remove oil from the water surface. The new equipment is part of the Environmental Response Equipment Modernization initiative under the Oceans Protection Plan, and will help bolster the Coast Guard’s ability to respond to on-water environmental threats. This is a critical component of Canada’s world-leading marine safety system, which will keep Canada’s waters and coasts safe and clean now and for future generations.\n",

      "News Release Text: Ottawa, Ontario Online child sexual exploitation is an abhorrent and horrific crime whose victims suffer devastating and long-lasting consequences; and technological advances have enabled this type of criminal activity to become more sophisticated. The Government of Canada, along with its international partners, is committed to protecting children from sexual exploitation of any kind. Today, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the Honourable Ralph Goodale, announced the expansion of the National Strategy for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet. Building on investments in Budgets 2017 and 2018 to combat online child sexual exploitation, Budget 2019 expanded its investment with an additional $22.24 million over three years to better protect children. These include: This funding will support Public Safety’s (PS) efforts towards the four pillars of the National Strategy: raising awareness of this serious issue; reducing the stigma associated with reporting; increasing Canada’s ability to pursue and prosecute offenders; and working together with industry to find new ways to combat the sexual exploitation of children online. Under the Contribution Program to Combat Serious and Organized Crime, PS will provide financial support to partners advancing prevention and intervention strategies. Last week, members of the Five Eyes security alliance of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom met in London, UK, with digital industry leaders including Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Snap and Roblox, about the online sexual exploitation of children. Ministers reiterated their expectations that digital industry will make it a priority to create a safer online environment for children, and agreed to continue to work cooperatively to combat this vile and despicable crime. \n",

      "News Release Text: June 27, 2019 – Montréal, Quebec The Government of Canada is committed to growing the economy, creating good jobs and keeping Canada competitive. That is why the Government has brought together small, medium-sized and large companies, academic institutions and not-for-profit organizations to develop major engines of innovation, growth and job creation under the ambitious Innovation Superclusters Initiative. Today, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, announced that the SCALE.AI Supercluster, based in Montréal, passed a major milestone with the selection of its first set of projects. Each of these initiatives will see companies explore ways AI can be used to reduce costs and improve efficiencies across the board in the consumer goods, farming, telecom and shipping sectors.  Minister Bains made the announcement at Ray-Mont Logistics, a Montréal-based logistics services company facilitating international trade by enhancing the container supply chain. It is leading a project that aims to make the use of shipping containers more efficient. Other approved projects will see more than 20 large and small firms, along with research partners, develop ways to improve their logistics and save costs. Canadians will reap tangible benefits from these projects. For example, a project led by Local Line, a Canadian online food wholesale and logistics company, is expected to significantly reduce transportation costs for farmers by using AI-informed algorithms to forecast shipping dates well into the future, enabling better planning and greater efficiency. The Innovation Superclusters Initiative, part of the Government of Canada’s Innovation and Skills Plan, takes a new approach to accelerating economic growth by creating hubs of global competitive advantage. This long-term program is making investments in five major hubs across the country, which are expected to create 50,000 jobs and contribute $50 billion to Canada’s GDP over the next 10 years.\n",

      "News Release Text: Newcomer women who are members of a visible minority group may face multiple barriers to success, including gender- and race-based discrimination, precarious or low income employment, lack of affordable childcare and weak social supports. Recognizing these challenges, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is providing additional funding of up to $5 million to 10 service provider organizations across Canada over the next 3 years to increase employment supports and services for newcomer women. The Inter-Cultural Association of Greater Victoria provides group orientation workshops targeted to newcomer women, as well as a variety of educational workshops and training seminars covering a range of topics related to multiculturalism, diversity awareness, immigration, and human rights in the workplace and community. This additional funding of $310,000 will help the association increase vital services for newcomer women. Identifying IRCC-funded service providers that are already offering strong programming for women and giving them additional funding will provide an immediate boost in capacity to support visible minority newcomer women. Today’s funding announcement is part of IRCC’s 3-year Visible Minority Newcomer Women Pilot, which also includes establishing new partnerships with organizations for women. On December 5, IRCC launched an expression of interest process for new partnerships with organizations for women not currently funded by the department. IRCC will provide up to $7 million in funding over the next 3 years for new, innovative programs and services to support visible minority women in accessing the labour market and to build capacity in smaller organizations that serve or are led by visible minority women.\n",

      "News Release Text: On September 14, 2023, the Prime Minister announced extended deadlines for Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) loan repayments, providing an additional year for term loan repayment, and additional flexibilities for loan holders looking to benefit from partial loan forgiveness of up to 33 per cent. The CEBA program was available from April 9, 2020, to June 30, 2021, and provided $49 billion in interest-free, partially forgivable loans of up to $60,000 to nearly 900,000 small businesses and not-for-profit organizations to help cover their operating costs during the pandemic. The repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness of up to 33 per cent is being extended from December 31, 2023, to January 18, 2024, recognizing that the end of December is a busy time for many Canadian businesses. This builds on the government’s previous one-year extension announced in January 2022. For CEBA loan holders who make a refinancing application with the financial institution that provided their CEBA loan by January 18, 2024, the repayment deadline to qualify for partial loan forgiveness now includes a refinancing extension until March 28, 2024. This will allow more small businesses and not-for-profits to access relief and give them more time to hear back from their financial institutions on refinancing applications. As of January 19, 2024, outstanding loans, including those that are captured by the refinancing extension, will convert to three-year term loans, subject to interest of five per cent per annum, with the term loan repayment date extended by an additional year from December 31, 2025, to December 31, 2026. Put simply, small businesses and not-for-profits will automatically have access to a three-year, low-interest loan of up to $60,000 if they have not repaid or refinanced their loan. This will provide those who are unable to secure refinancing or generate enough cashflow to repay their loans by the forgiveness deadline an additional year to continue repayment at a low borrowing cost. Repayment on or before the new deadline of January 18, 2024 (or March 28, 2024 if a refinancing application is submitted prior to January 18, 2024 at the financial institution that provided their CEBA loan), will result in loan forgiveness of $10,000 for a $40,000 loan and $20,000 for a $60,000 loan. Here are examples of how CEBA loan holders can benefit from new repayment flexibility: Financial institutions will contact CEBA loan holders directly regarding their loans.  The above changes also apply to CEBA-equivalent lending through the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund. \n",

      "News Release Text: October 30, 2023 | Toronto, ON | Health Canada  Canada is in the midst of one of the most serious public health crises in our country’s history - the toxic and illegal drug and overdose crisis. No community has been left untouched. That’s why we are leveraging all the tools at our disposal to work towards an end to this national public health crisis—including prevention, harm reduction, treatment, recovery and enforcement. Today, the Honourable Ya’ara Saks, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health, announced more than $21 million in federal funding for 52 projects through Health Canada's Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP). With this funding, organizations will be able to increase access to much needed services for those who use drugs and help improve health outcomes for people who are at risk of experiencing substance-related harms. Investing in programs like SUAP is a key part of the renewed Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy also released today. The renewed CDSS builds on the work, engagement and consultation since it was originally launched in 2016, including that of the Expert Task Force on Substance Use. The Government of Canada is using an integrated approach to address the overdose crisis and other substance use harms in Canada. Supporting community-based organizations across the country helps reduce stigma and meet the unique needs of the people in their communities where they are at, getting them the services and supports they need, when they need it. The Government of Canada will continue to work with all levels of government, public health and public safety partners, social sectors, Indigenous communities, stakeholders, people with lived and living experience, and community organizations across the country to support a full range of services and improve health outcomes for all Canadians, save lives and work towards an end to this national public health crisis.  \n",

If so, the CBSA will continue its investigations and, by October 18, 2018, will issue preliminary determinations. If these preliminary determinations indicate that there has been dumping, the CBSA will then continue its investigation and, concurrently, the Tribunal will initiate a final injury inquiry. Anti-dumping duties will be imposed only if the Tribunal finds that dumped products are injuring or threatening to injure the Canadian domestic industry.

      "News Release Text: Canada is investing in community-led clean energy projects with rural and remote Indigenous communities to develop innovative solutions that will displace fossil fuels, advance reconciliation and self-determination, and combat climate change. Yvonne Jones, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Northern Affairs and Member of Parliament for Labrador, on behalf of the Honourable Seamus O’Regan Jr., Minister of Natural Resources, today announced a $2.8-million investment to support three community-led clean energy projects across the northern coast of Labrador. These projects will build capacity and help rural and remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel and fossil fuels for heat and power. Each project is unique, but all of them share the same goals: building a clean energy future, supporting new economic opportunities and creating more energy-resilient communities by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. All three projects were funded through Natural Resources Canada's Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program, a $220-million program to reduce reliance on diesel in rural, remote and Indigenous communities by deploying and demonstrating renewable energy technologies, encouraging energy efficiency and building local skills and capacity. The program is part of the government’s Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, a more than $180-billion investment in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities. Canada’s strengthened climate plan, A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, ensures Canada will remain a world leader in clean power. Canada is investing an additional $300 million over five years to help rural, remote and Indigenous communities, currently reliant on fossil fuels, to transition to clean, reliable energy by 2030.\n",

Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable Jim Carr, was in Vancouver today, where he reaffirmed the Government’s support for last year’s major pipeline decisions and highlighted its three guiding pillars with respect to the projects: safety and environmental protection, job creation and partnering with Indigenous peoples to monitor construction and operations. Speaking at the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade’s 2017 Energy Forum, Minister Carr said Canadians understand the transition to a cleaner energy future is well underway — something they made clear during Generation Energy, the largest public engagement on energy in Canadian history. The Minister also noted that support for pipeline projects is not at odds with this vision for a low-carbon future. The Minister also took the opportunity to highlight the crucial role British Columbia plays in Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy, leading the way on environmental issues, recognizing the importance of protecting our oceans and the important role Indigenous people must play in the development of our natural resources.

They discussed how everyone, regardless of their gender, must be able to contribute to and benefit equally from political, economic, social and cultural life. The foreign ministers demonstrated a commitment to take an active approach to advancing this shared vision, and discussed a number of strategies they are already pursuing to advance these objectives. A recurrent theme was their strong commitment to collaboratively reinforce and reform the rules-based international order so that it can best respond to the multiple challenges their countries and citizens face and effectively advance democracy, human rights, peace and human development around the world. Their discussions were enhanced by the diversity of perspectives that were brought to bear.

For the good of the planet’s health, the world is moving off thermal coal for energy production, and Canada is leading the way. Burning thermal coal, the fuel that powered an industrial revolution in a previous century, is the single largest contributor to climate change and a major source of toxic pollution that harms human health. Since co-founding the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2017 with the United Kingdom and introducing regulations to accelerate the phase-out of conventional coal-fired electricity, Canada has helped set the pace for domestic and international action in addressing this source of greenhouse gas emissions. Last month Canada, alongside other G7 countries, stressed the need to immediately end international investments in thermal coal power generation projects that emit carbon pollution. As G7 world leaders gather in the U.K. to combat global challenges, including climate change, and as the next step in Canada’s commitment to addressing harmful GHG emissions from coal, the Honorable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, today announced the Government of Canada’s public policy statement on new thermal coal mining or expansion projects. The statement indicates that the Government considers that these projects are likely to cause unacceptable environmental effects within federal jurisdiction and are not aligned with Canada’s domestic and international climate change commitments. Accordingly, this position will inform federal decision making on thermal coal mining projects. Today’s policy announcement provides clarity and regulatory certainty for industry, investors and Canadians. It represents another critical step in our shared path to a cleaner and more prosperous future, and places Canada among the first G7 countries to adopt such a policy. In parallel to today’s announcement, Minister Wilkinson informed Coalspur Mines Ltd. that the policy announced today applies to the consideration of its proposed thermal coal mine expansions at the Vista Coal Mine near Hinton, Alberta. Canada’s abundant natural resources give this country a competitive advantage we have always used to support jobs and prosperity. In the global race to carbon-neutral economies by 2050, Canada continues to build on its long-term competitive advantage by focusing on environmental sustainability and clean growth while supporting workers and communities. That is why, for example, Canada’s strengthened climate plan—A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy—committed $964 million over four years to advance smart renewable energy and grid modernization projects to enable the clean grid and jobs of the future. And that is why, to mitigate the impacts of the domestic phase out of coal-fired electricity, Budgets 2018 and 2019 provided $185 million for skills development, economic diversification, and infrastructure to support coal workers and communities. The evidence is clear: the continued mining and use of thermal coal for energy production in the world runs counter to what is needed to effectively combat climate change and seize the economic opportunities that it presents. It is in this context that the Government has announced this policy today and will continue to work with Canadians to deliver strong climate action.\n",

      "News Release Text: Check against delivery. This speech has been translated in accordance with the Government of Canada’s official languages policy and edited for posting and distribution in accordance with its communications policy. It’s a great pleasure to be here in the Port of Montreal because, well, as you can see, this is where trade literally happens. What can be lost in the hustle and bustle of this place is that this is the point of departure for a middle class Canadians’ first exports; the very moment when she realizes her hopes and ambitions to go global. It is fitting then that we stand here today surrounded by innovative Canadians and business owners of all sizes to usher in a new era of trade, to proudly celebrate a new chapter between the European Union and Canada and, most importantly, to celebrate CETA, the gold-standard in progressive trade and an ambitious deal that puts people, particularly the middle class, front and centre. This is a great day for Montréalers, Quebekers and all Canadians. We have worked hard in anticipation of this day for ten years. We may not have realized it then but this is the right deal at the right time. As of today, 98 percent of tariff lines between Canada and the EU will be duty free.  More than 9000 tariff lines are duty-free. As of today, Canadians have access to a market of more than 500 million consumers and a procurement market worth a staggering $3.3 trillion. Consumers will be getting more choice and lower prices and that’s good for access, good for competition and great news for Canadians looking to expand, succeed and win in the world’s most lucrative market. Canadians now have preferential market access, through 12 trade agreements to 44 countries with almost 1.2 billion consumers and a combined GDP of over US$41.2 trillion. This represents over one-half of the world’s output of goods and services. Canada is now literally at the centre of a network of free trade agreements connecting the Americas, Asia and Europe. That is important because in a world marked by instability and uncertainty, Canada (and the EU) can be proud of the fact that we are beacons of stability, predictability, the rule of law. We can be proud of our diverse societies where fairness is prioritized and where the future prosperity of the middle class matters most.   The timing of CETA is another big advantage for Canada. Canadians will be first in line to establish customer relationships, networks and joint projects in the EU. When you unwind the red tape tangling up imports and exports, business owners can expand their enterprises. We reached this milestone because while we know that trade matters, we needed to rethink how we approached trade agreements. As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set out for us on Day One, we need to make ‘trade real for people’. So together with our European Union counterparts, we reoriented the approach to trade so that it is progressive.  We put the middle class and those working hard to join it first. Because if we are not working hard to make trade real for people and giving Canadians a fair shot to ensure their future prosperity than we are standing still and letting others set the agenda for us. As Canada’s chief marketing officer, I know Canadians can compete and win in overseas markets. During my official travels, I’ve had the opportunity to see many great Canadian businesses diversify into and succeed in new markets around the world. For Hygie Canada CETA represents a golden opportunity to be on an equal footing with our European Union competitors and to be able to access public markets without being disadvantaged by tariffs. Little Miss Chief’s Indigenous owned company from Westbank British Colombia’s already exports wine-marinated wild Pacific salmon to the Netherlands, Poland and Spain … The EU imported $36 million of fish and seafood in 2016 so there is the potential to make even more of a splash. And, a Metis man, Richard Martin, who had a vision of innovative children’s play equipment that could truly challenge children around the world to overcome obstacles, reach new heights and proudly realize their own capabilities. With CETA, the current EU tariffs on Dynamo Playground’s products drop to zero and open up the procurement markets in all levels of government across the EU for Dynamo to sell more, more, more. Purkinje Inc. is a Montreal-based company specialized in offering IT solutions in the field of healthcare to facilitate the work of health professionals, serving over 7000 health professionals across Canada and abroad. The company currently operates in China and India, and is interested in the European Union. The company’s Co-President, Mary-Anne Carignan, sees in CETA an opportunity for Purkinje to diversify and expand, drawing on the company’s diversity and CETA’s labour mobility commitments. CETA shows us that no business is too small to succeed and that the ambitions of middle class Canadians can be at the forefront of our agenda. And with our government’s investments in skills training, youth and innovation, more Canadians are well-positioned to grow and to create more middle-class jobs. Trade Matters.  Trade is vital to our economic success in the 21st century: to job creation, to a strong middle class, and to the prosperity of those working hard to join it. When we offer SMEs more opportunities to export and hard-working Canadians the skills and support they need to take advantage of new markets, to access larger buyers and supply chains, we all benefit. This is where you come in. The Canadian businesses and workers gathered here, the future entrepreneurs and students brimming with ideas around the country; all of you bring these agreements to life. Every small business owner knows the distance from their first spark of an idea to putting it into practice is a long and challenging road. While sometimes it feels risky to pursue overseas markets where language, culture, practices and market preferences may be different, smart business owners understand that this type of diversification is actually an important risk-management tool when weather or political uncertainty disrupt primary export markets. I encourage all Canadians to use the tools we have like our trade commissioners on the ground; they are located in 26 embassies and consulates in the EU, and their job is to connect all Canadians to the opportunities that CETA has created. Ladies and gentlemen, we set a high level of ambition for progressive trade and for putting the interests of our middle class front and centre. CETA has delivered. CETA demonstrates that we can improve the rules that govern trade.  Just as Canada was a principal architect of the rules that governed the post-WWII global economic order, we are rewriting those rules for the 21st century economy today.  We are rewriting them so that everyone benefits. CETA demonstrates that we can set the terms for a more fair and progressive global trade agenda where the middle class can see themselves competing and winning on the global stage.  Canada can and will chart the course of our 21st century prosperity.  As we stand here at this gateway to the world let’s prove that.  Let’s be ambitious. Trade matters.  Now is our time. Thank you.  Merci.\n",

      "News Release Text: May 16, 2018, Ottawa, Ontario Canada’s planned purchase of 88 new fighter jets would be its largest aerospace buy in more than 30 years. It presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create jobs and generate benefits for Canadians. The purchase of these jets is subject to the Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy, which requires that for every dollar the government spends on major defence purchases, the winning contractor must put a dollar back into Canada’s economy. Through this policy, the government’s purchasing power is being used to support innovation and create well-paying middle-class jobs. This was the message delivered at a series of six regional forums held across the country by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, in concert with National Defence, Public Services and Procurement Canada, and the regional development agencies. Representatives from more than 250 companies and 50 universities and research institutions participated in a total of 750 meetings. They were able to meet directly with fighter manufacturers and start building relationships and partnerships during these forums, positioning them to take advantage of the opportunities that will come from this large-scale procurement. By working with Canada’s aerospace and defence industries, our government is making sure that Canadians get the most benefits possible from large defence purchases.\n",

      "News Release Text: November 17, 2022 Today, Bill C-31, the Cost of Living Relief Act, No. 2 (Targeted Support for Households), received Royal Assent. This legislation delivers two targeted affordability measures for the Canadians who need it most: the Canada Dental Benefit and a one-time top-up to the Canada Housing Benefit. The Canada Dental Benefit will provide eligible parents or guardians with up to $650 tax-free per year for two years to cover dental expenses for children under 12. This benefit, which will support an estimated 500,000 children, is available to families without access to private dental insurance and with an adjusted family net income under $90,000. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will begin receiving applications and processing payments for the benefit starting December 1, 2022. The one-time top-up to the Canada Housing Benefit will provide a tax-free payment of $500 to an estimated 1.8 million low-income renters who are struggling with the cost of housing. This top-up is available to applicants with an adjusted net income below $35,000 for families, or below $20,000 for single Canadians, who pay at least 30 per cent of their adjusted net income towards rent. The CRA will begin receiving applications and processing payments for this top-up starting December 12, 2022. In addition to Bill C-31, the government is already delivering targeted and fiscally responsible measures to support Canadians, with particular emphasis on addressing the needs of low-income Canadians who are most exposed to inflation.\n",

As the custodian of nearly 50 places with a connection to the World Wars among its broad network of 171 national historic sites, 46 national parks, one national urban park, and four national marine conservation areas, Parks Canada actively supports these national commemorations. Parks Canada’s Hometown Heroes initiative honours the courage of individuals from all walks of life who made unique contributions to the war effort. Their exploits are told through panels, exhibits and special events across the country. To date, more than 25 Parks Canada places have taken part in the program with more than 100 individuals recognized. As a complementary initiative, Parks Canada’s Home Port Heroes pays tribute to the courage and sacrifice of those who participated in the Battles of the Atlantic and the St. Lawrence. Through the lens of the Merchant Navy, in particular that of the men and women from every province who served in, and built the ships of this vital transportation service, the heroic story of defending the Allied lifeline is told. Nearly 30 merchant ships were named after national parks or forts of national historic importance managed by Parks Canada. In 2018, Parks Canada, in conjunction with the Royal Canadian Navy and community partners, are hosting a number of public events across the country to raise awareness of Canada’s nautical history during the Second World War through ceremonies, exhibits and multi-generational hands-on activities.\n",

Whether you have a busy job and little time to cook at home, you may be trying to please a picky eater in the house, or you may be managing a chronic condition like diabetes – a balanced, nutritional diet can be difficult to maintain. I can certainly understand those challenges, as the demands of a Minister’s schedule mean that I spend a significant amount of time away from home myself.  The theme of this year’s Dietitians of Canada National Nutrition Month campaign is Take the Fight out of Food. It is dedicated to easing people’s frustrations surrounding food and helping Canadians find the joy in eating again.  Canadians today have access to more food-related information than ever before. Unfortunately, much of the information that is available online can be conflicting and often confusing. It’s important to seek information and advice from credible sources. HealthyCanadians.gc.ca contains a comprehensive section on food and nutrition, with consumer-friendly information on topics ranging from healthy eating to food recalls, risks and outbreaks. Dietitians of Canada also has extensive resources on healthy eating, including links to find a dietitian in your area. Last October, as part of my vision for a healthy Canada, I announced Canada’s Healthy Eating Strategy, which aims to make the healthier food choice the easier choice for all Canadians. As part of the Strategy, our Government has committed to updating Canada’s Food Guide to make it more useful and relevant to Canadians. The Strategy also outlines how we will meet our commitments to strengthening nutritional information and ingredient labelling, including sugars and food colours; reducing sodium in foods; eliminating industrially produced trans fat; and restricting marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children.  We’re also supporting innovative programs and partnerships like APPLE Schools and Kid Food Nation, which help children and youth build healthy eating habits. When it comes to leading a healthy lifestyle, healthy eating and physical activity go hand-in-hand. That is why we are also supporting initiatives, such as Carrot Insights, that encourage Canadians to get active in their day-to-day lives.  This month, take steps towards improving your relationship with food and finding the joy in healthy eating.

      "News Release Text: Our businesses and workers are key to a successful economy and Canada’s economic growth was the strongest in the G7 over the last year. More Canadians are employed today than before the pandemic, including more than 360,000 here in Ontario. Budget 2023 outlines the federal government’s plan to build on this momentum and create a more secure, sustainable and affordable Canada from coast to coast to coast.  Today, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), was in London with Arielle Kayabaga, Member of Parliament for London West, and Peter Fragiskatos, Member of Parliament for London North Centre. They met employees at the businesses that are creating jobs across the region and driving our aerospace, automotive and clean tech industries. They met with employees at General Dynamics Land Systems Canada, an advanced manufacturer, as well as one of southern Ontario’s largest defence contractors and a key employer in the London region. They then met with students at Fanshawe College’s Innovation Village, a hub supported by a $3-million FedDev Ontario investment to help students and entrepreneurs to commercialize their ideas, create jobs and strengthen the local economy. Following a meeting with Unifor Local 27 representatives, the Minister spoke with workers at Sodecia London. The tier 1 supplier in the automotive industry previously received a $3.5-million FedDev Ontario investment to adopt advanced technologies and manufacture safer and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Minister Tassi highlighted the government’s plan for investing in the clean economy: a set of clear and predictable investment tax credits, low-cost strategic financing, and targeted investments and programming, where necessary, to respond to the unique needs of sectors or projects of national economic significance. Later in the day, Minister Tassi visited J2 Bouldering, a rock climbing centre that received a previous non-repayable FedDev Ontario contribution of $100,000 through the Regional Tourism Organization (RTO 1). The Minister highlighted Budget 2023’s commitment to supporting hardworking small business owners by working with major credit card companies to lower transaction fees and by providing reduced tax rates, low-cost strategic financing, and targeted funding as part of a “Made-in-Canada Plan” that will attract global investments, lock-in labour standards, and create great middle class jobs. She also noted the new Federal Tourism Growth Strategy for growth, investment and stability in Canada’s tourism sector. Through these measures and more, Budget 2023 will ensure that workers across all sectors, share in enhancing Canada’s economic prosperity for generations to come.\n",

In a joint statement led by National Parks UK, as the host nation for this year’s United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) 26, signatories acknowledge that no single site or organization can address the global crisis of climate change nor the exacerbating impact of climate change on biodiversity loss. However, as a family of protected and conserved areas distributed all around the World, and focusing on collaboration and global ambitions for rapid and far-reaching actions to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, our global network aspires to be the “first 30 per cent” that inspires nature-based solutions and informs land and sea use choices across the planet – the places where billions of people connect with nature and become inspired to play an active part in combatting the dual crises. Parks Canada administers one of the finest and most extensive systems of natural and cultural heritage places in the world, which are a source of shared pride for all Canadians. Ron Hallman, President & CEO of Parks Canada Agency, signed the Statement virtually today, as part of the COP26 Youth Day events.                                                                           -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: Joanne Thompson, Member of Parliament for St. John's East, on behalf of the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Honourable Bernard Davis, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, on behalf of the Honourable Derrick Bragg, Minister of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture, today announced an $800,000 investment from the Canadian Agricultural Partnership that will help Country Ribbon Inc. deliver more fresh, local chicken to major retailers in Newfoundland and Labrador through the purchase of air-chill technology and secondary processing equipment. Minister Davis and MP Thompson made the announcement at Country Ribbon Inc.'s farm complex near Cochrane Pond. They were joined by Ian MacKinnon, president of Country Ribbon Inc. There is a growing demand for locally raised chicken that is air-chilled as opposed to water chilled. Unlike traditional cooling methods, air-chill technology cools the product without retaining excess moisture. By changing its cooling technology, Country Ribbon will increase the amount of local chicken sold in grocery stores across Newfoundland and Labrador and substantially improve food self-sufficiency in the province. This project is funded under the Partnership's Agriculture Processing and Value-Added Program to help realize new market opportunities, and will enhance poultry processing capacity, support food safety practices, and produce quality poultry products. The investment is expected to help Country Ribbon access new domestic markets and increase food self-sufficiency in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a $3-billion, five-year (2018-2023) investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments to innovate, strengthen and grow Canada's agriculture and agri-foods sector. This includes a $2-billion commitment that is cost-shared 60% federally and 40% provincially/territorially for programs that are designed and delivered by provinces and territories. The program will be replaced by the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a new $3.5-billion, five-year agreement, between the federal, provincial and territorial governments, in effect from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2028. In the first four years, the Partnership has committed approximately $26 million to fund 558 agriculture projects in Newfoundland and Labrador, including 46 new, first-year farmers. Projects under the Partnership focus on new entrants, secondary processing, food self-sufficiency, climate change, and risk mitigation for the agriculture industry. They also support innovation and environmental sustainability. More information on the Partnership is available in the backgrounder below.\n",

The purpose of the RFQ is to identify and qualify up to three top candidates who will be invited to participate in the Request for Proposals (RFP) process, anticipated to begin in summer 2023. The procurement process will help select a private developer partner to work in collaboration with VIA HFR, the newly created subsidiary of VIA Rail, to design and develop the High Frequency Rail project. The Request for Qualifications is the next step following the Request for Expressions of Interest that opened in March 2022. The Request for Qualifications launches the formal procurement process and outlines: The High Frequency Rail procurement process is designed to encourage innovation, provide flexibility, and identify the optimal solution for the project. Therefore, RFQ respondents will have the flexibility to consider alternatives to meet or exceed the project results described in the Request for Qualifications. This would include opportunities to increase speeds beyond 200 kilometers per hour on some segments of the High Frequency Rail project, if it is cost effective to do so. To qualify as a candidate for the RFP, RFQ respondents will be required to demonstrate a capacity for reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples by developing the project to create mutually beneficial, socio-economic development opportunities. In addition to leveraging the knowledge and expertise of international private sector companies that have experience developing large-scale infrastructure projects, delivering the High Frequency Rail project will require substantial Canadian expertise, Canadian labour, and Canadian companies throughout all phases of the project, including construction and operations. The Government of Canada will be encouraging the private developer partner to maximize economic benefits to Canadians and Canadian suppliers while respecting Canada’s rules-based approach to international trade.  \n",

      "News Release Text: The African Development Bank (AfDB) is a key institution that plays a critical role in the growth and development of Africa. The Government of Canada is a long-standing partner in delivering on shared objectives alongside the AfDB.  The Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister of International Development and Minister for Women and Gender Equality, today announced that Canada is willing to temporarily increase its subscription of callable capital at the African Development Bank by up to US$1.1 billion, if necessary, while the AfDB negotiates a permanent capital increase among all of its 80 member states. Minister Monsef made this announcement at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. Callable capital serves as a guarantee from shareholders that the AfDB may call on, as required, to meet its obligations on borrowed funds. Canada has strong confidence in the AfDB’s capital adequacy framework, which is why it is willing to provide this temporary callable capital, if necessary, to support the bank and its clients. The temporary callable capital requested by the AfDB of its AAA-rated shareholders, such as Canada, will allow the AfDB to maintain its AAA credit rating and its support to client countries during the general capital-increase negotiations. It would allow the AfDB to continue the important development work that is helping provide much-needed transport and energy infrastructure to the continent. Through its loans the AfDB has supported clean energy and improved agricultural technologies, helped small businesses gain access to financial services, and helped provide many thousands of people with clean water, improved sanitation and quality education. Once the terms of the general capital increase are agreed upon by shareholders, Canada’s temporary callable capital would no longer be needed and would be withdrawn. Gender equality is also an integral part of the AfDB’s vision for Africa. This includes helping create opportunities for women and disadvantaged and marginalized people and communities so they can participate in and benefit from the development of their communities and nations.\n",

      "News Release Text: The West Indian Domestic Scheme was a targeted immigration program through which approximately 3,000 women from the Caribbean came to Canada to work as domestic servants. While still very restrictive, it increased Black immigration to Canada in the post-Second World War era, when discriminatory immigration policies limited the entry of non-white immigrants. The Scheme combined an immigration program with Canadian diplomacy as part of Canada’s evolving economic relationships with Caribbean nations. It also contributed to the growth of Caribbean culture in Canada, especially within the Toronto and Montréal communities. The Department of Citizenship and Immigration launched the Scheme in 1955 to help meet the demand for domestic labour. In its first year, there was a quota of 100, but the system was so successful that annual quotas increased through the 1960s. To be eligible, women had to be single, between 18 and 35 years of age, have at least an 8th grade education, and pass a medical examination conducted by Canadian immigration officials. Through this process, they were subjected to a level of ‘moral’ scrutiny that was not only unique compared to other immigration programs but also significantly influenced the way they were perceived in Canada as well as their lived experience in the program. The women who came to Canada as part of the scheme were paid less than they anticipated while also being required to work longer hours. After a year of domestic work, the women were granted landed immigrant status and permitted to seek educational and employment opportunities in other fields while also being able to sponsor family members’ permanent residency in Canada, which the government tried to limit by only accepting single women. After five years in the country, regardless of if they continued to work in the domestic field, they were eligible for Canadian citizenship. Once accepted into the program, women had the opportunity to select their preferred destination, with most choosing Toronto or Montréal. Between 1955 and 1961, 580 of the 1600 women who came to Canada as part of the scheme selected Montréal. There were efforts made to spread the women across the country, in particular to rural and western Canada, but most preferred the social and economic opportunities presented by large urban centres. The women confronted racial discrimination and hostility on arrival in Canada. Few had worked as domestics before migrating and many had no plans to continue working in the domestic field after a year. This included women like the Honourable Jean Augustine, who migrated to Canada in 1960 from Grenada. Following her year working in domestic labour, she enrolled at the University of Toronto where she earned a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Education before becoming a principal and getting involved in community activism. In 1993, she was the first Black Canadian woman elected to the House of Commons, and was appointed to a Cabinet post in 2002. Despite its success in attracting West Indian women to Canada and a seemingly unlimited demand for domestic labour, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration was reluctant to increase the number of women admitted each year. In 1967 it was announced that, with Canada moving towards a points system for immigration, the West Indian Domestic Scheme would be discontinued in January 1968. The National Program of Historical Commemoration relies on the participation of Canadians in the identification of places, events and persons of national historic significance. Any member of the public can nominate a topic for consideration by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Information on how to participate in this process is available here:  https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/culture/clmhc-hsmbc/ncp-pcn. Parks Canada and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada wish to thank Nadine Williams for nominating the West Indian Domestic Scheme under the National Program of Historical Commemoration.

      "News Release Text: Born and trained in Canada, heavyweight boxer Larry Gains gained prominence in the 1920s and 1930s by winning the Canadian and British Empire Titles. Despite his reputation as one of boxing’s top competitors, discrimination and racism in the interwar years worked against his ability to challenge for the World Heavyweight Title. Like all Black boxers at the time, he was restricted to the segregated World Colored Championship. While the majority of his bouts were held in Europe, Gains represented Canada as national champion and attracted large crowds to his fights. His drawing power was so strong that he broke the colour bar at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England, becoming the first Black boxer to compete in the famed venue. Known for his quick feet, strong left hook, and nearly impenetrable defence, Gains posted impressive victories over multiple fighters who would go on to win the World Heavyweight Title. Born 12 December 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Lawrence Samuel “Larry” Gains was one of the most talented boxers in the first half of the 20th century. His maternal grandfather, Dave Henderson, escaped enslavement in Virginia and came to Canada via the Underground Railroad. Gains grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Toronto’s east end, where he was a big fan of American Jack Johnson, the first Black Heavyweight World Champion. As a young man, Gains trained at the Praestamus Athletic Club, which was an organization for Black boxers in Toronto. Gains’s first bout came in an amateur competition where he faced Charlie McDalton, who had been Canada’s amateur champion for the better part of a decade. Gains lost the fight, but impressed a local trainer who worked with him over the next six months, primarily on developing his left hand. In the rematch, Gains defeated McDalton in a second round knockout. As his reputation grew, earning a living as a boxer emerged as a possibility for Gains. In order to further his career, he turned professional and moved to England in 1923. It was difficult for Gains to find top-level fights in North America, where racial discrimination limited his opportunities. While fighting internationally was common for professional fighters, Black North American fighters frequently moved to Europe with the hopes they would have their athletic achievements assessed on an equal basis with their white opponents. While fighters like Gains did find some success, they did so under the constant shadow of boxing’s global colour line, which restricted their chances to face top-level opponents and earn title opportunities. After losing his first fight in England, he relocated to Paris where he found success before moving to Germany in 1924. His biggest fight during this time was on 28 August 1925 when he knocked out future World Heavyweight Champion Max Schmeling in the second round. He won his first professional title in February 1927, becoming the Canadian Heavyweight Champion. A year later, struggling to secure fights against top white boxers, he compromised with the World Colored Heavyweight Title. He then settled in England and, in 1932, broke the British Empire boxing colour bar by challenging for and winning the Empire Heavyweight Title. Racial discrimination continued to limit his career as non-white athletes were barred from competing for the English Heavyweight Title and promoters maintained an unofficial colour barrier for the World Heavyweight Title, both championships for which he was a legitimate contender. He officially retired from boxing in 1941. Gains died of a heart attack on 26 July 1983 while visiting family in Cologne, Germany. The National Program of Historical Commemoration relies on the participation of Canadians in the identification of places, events and persons of national historic significance. Any member of the public can nominate a topic for consideration by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Information on how to participate in this process is available here:  https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/culture/clmhc-hsmbc/ncp-pcn. Parks Canada and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada wish to thank Peter Meyler for nominating Larry Gains under the National Program of Historical Commemoration.  Peter Meyler is an author of a number of works in Black Canadian history. -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: On February 14, 2022, the Government of Canada declared a public order emergency. The Emergency Economic Measures Order implements the following measures, which come into force immediately and will be in effect for 30 days: First, the order extends the scope of Canada’s anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing rules to cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment processors they use. This change covers all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. As of this order, crowdfunding platforms, and payment service providers that are in possession or control of any funds that are owned, held or controlled by or on behalf of anyone involved in the illegal blockades are required to register with and report suspicious or large value transactions to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). Second, the order immediately directs Canadian banks, property and casualty insurance companies, and other financial service providers to temporarily cease providing financial services where the institution suspects that an account – either personal or corporate – is being used to further the illegal blockades. This applies to all funds, including those held in a deposit, chequing, savings, or trading account, and to cryptocurrency wallets, lending products, investment assets, and insurance policies for vehicles used in the illegal blockades. Third, the government is directing Canadian financial institutions to review their relationships with anyone involved in the illegal blockades and report the assets and related transactions of those involved to the RCMP or CSIS. Fourth, the order provides federal, provincial, and territorial government institutions with new authority to share relevant information with banks and other financial services providers, if the information will help put a stop to the funding of illegal blockades and illegal activities. As of now, Canadian financial service providers will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account of an individual or business affiliated with the blockades without a court order. These new requirements and authorities will help mitigate the risk that Canadian financial institutions and crowdfunding platforms transact illicit funds, increase the quality and quantity of intelligence received by FINTRAC, and make more information available to support investigations by law enforcement into the illegal blockades. \n",

      "News Release Text: Vancouver, BC - Chinook salmon populations have been in decline for years as a result of a number of factors including habitat destruction, harvest, and the effects of climate change. The challenges facing at-risk Fraser River Chinook salmon stocks are multi-faceted. The road to recovery requires a long-term view and the collaboration of all interested parties.  Today, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is releasing 2020 Fisheries management measures that will support the recovery of at-risk Fraser River Chinook populations, as well as protect the jobs and communities that depend on Chinook. The 2020 measures include additional restrictions to strengthen conservation as well as the flexibility needed where impacts to stocks of concern will be very low. These measures were developed following consultation with Indigenous communities, recreational and commercial fishing organizations, and environmental organizations. These measures are one component of a larger strategy intended to place at-risk Pacific salmon populations on a path towards sustainability. Working with First Nations and stakeholders, we are confident we are taking steps to ensure healthier Chinook stocks while maintaining a high degree of protection for endangered Fraser River Chinook. Of the thirteen wild Fraser River Chinook salmon populations assessed, only one is not at risk. The loss of Chinook salmon would be disastrous not just for wildlife that depend on them as a food source, but also for the many First Nations and communities whose ways of life and jobs depend on Fraser Chinook salmon. Fisheries and Oceans Canada took unprecedented fisheries management measures in 2019 to protect Fraser River Chinook stocks, including efforts to clear the Big Bar Landslide, which further threatened the species. We will continue to assess fish passage at the Big Bar landslide and consider these circumstances in making fisheries management decisions as the season progresses. The Government of Canada is taking significant action to ensure that our Chinook salmon survive for future generations. The measures announced today highlight the government’s commitment to working collaboratively to ensure the sustainability of Chinook stocks as a means by which to ensure the health of our ecosystems and the long term prosperity of Indigenous and coastal communities.\n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is committed to building modern community infrastructure while protecting the environment. Improving road conditions creates stronger links between communities, facilitates the transportation of goods and offers better opportunities for community development. Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, announced that the proposed Route 389 Improvement Project between Fire Lake and Fermont is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects when the mitigation measures are taken into account. In reaching her decision, the Minister considered the Comprehensive Study Report, as well as comments received from First Nations and the public. The project consists of improving Route 389 between Fire Lake and Fermont in order to increase road safety and the flow of traffic. The project will also improve the link with Newfoundland and Labrador and facilitate access to natural resources. The project was assessed as a comprehensive study under the former Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (updated in 2010). The Minister has referred the project to the responsible authorities, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Infrastructure Canada. The responsible authorities will ensure that all necessary mitigation measures and follow-up programs, as described in the Comprehensive Study Report, are implemented. Mitigation measures include the use of trucks with retractable tarpaulins to limit dust emissions during the transportation of granular materials, and the avoidance of all activities (deforestation, stripping, mowing, etc.) that could hinder bird nesting. Today's announcement reflects the Government of Canada's Interim Approach and Principles for environmental assessments, which ensures that project decisions are informed by meaningful consultations with Indigenous peoples, public input and scientific evidence, including Indigenous Knowledge, and consideration of the project's greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

Implementing partner: International Foundation for Electoral Systems Funding: $6.2 million This funding will support civil society, lawmakers, media, government and academic institutions in undertaking structural reforms to promote inclusive governance, gender inclusivity and equality, and the empowerment of women and girls in Ukraine. Implementing partner: National Democratic Institute Funding: $4.8 million With this contribution to the National Democratic Institute, Canada will continue to actively promote women’s participation in elections by empowering women candidates and youth and, in particular, young women leaders to run for office. Implementing partner: United Nations Development Programme Funding: $78,000 Canada is the main contributor to a UN Development Programme study identifying the constraints on and limitations of the integrity of the democratic process and electoral system in Ukraine. The conclusions of this study will directly inform election observation missions, including Canada’s. Countering disinformation Funding: Up to $2.5 million Russia’s hybrid war in Ukraine includes engaging in disinformation activities to influence the outcomes of the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections in March and October 2019. Russia’s objective is to disrupt the stability of the Ukrainian state and throw into question the very legitimacy of democracy in the eyes of Ukrainian citizens. In response, Canada will provide a package of support to assist the Government of Ukraine, civil society and independent media to counter Russian disinformation activities in advance of the 2019 elections. An element of this support will target the non-government controlled areas, with the aim of encouraging residents of these areas to exercise their democratic right to vote.\n",

      "News Release Text: Thank you very much for that kind introduction. Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here.I'd like to first recognize that we are on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of New Credit. And I'd like to thank Tulip Retail for hosting us today.Our government believes that newcomers play a vital role in our society. From coast to coast to coast, immigration in partnership with our welcoming society has truly shaped the country that we all call home. But the question is: why do we need immigration? Well, five million Canadians are set to retire by 2035. And we have fewer people working to support seniors and retirees. Immigration supports GDP growth by creating jobs, attracting investment, and driving innovation. Immigration is vital to all of us. And that is why today, I'm so pleased to share a historic and responsible plan to grow our future.Our government has just tabled the Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration, including Canada's historic multi-year immigration levels plan, which will responsibly grow the annual number of permanent residents that Canada welcomes over the next three years. In 2018 we plan to welcome 310,000 permanent residents to Canada. That number will increase to 330,000 in 2019, and 340,000 in 2020. This will move us towards one percent of the population. This plan will result in the most ambitious immigration levels in recent Canadian history, and represents a major future into Canada's prosperity now and into the future.According to the Conference Board of Canada, in order to sustain a healthy level of economic growth across the country, we will need to increase our immigration levels to up to one percent of our population within the next few decades. Our current immigration levels stand at around 0.8 percent, and this historic, multi-year immigration plan that I'm announcing today will bring us up to around 0.9 percent by 2020.Immigration has had an immeasurable effect on our country.It's been a driving force in the progress that Canada has been able to make over many years. Generations of newcomers have come from other places in the world and have shaped and helped shape our prosperity, diversity, and our nation's cultural fabric. I look no further than Ali, our host, the son of immigrant parents whose mother fled persecution in Uganda. And his example and the example of his parents destroys the myth that newcomers and their families drain our resources and are a burden to our society. You can see very clearly that Ali and his parents have contributed so much to Canada by innovating, creating their own businesses, and hiring so many Canadians, thereby contributing to our common prosperity. And I'm proud that I was once one of those newcomers.At the same time, immigration is key to our future success.Immigration has played a significant role in Canada in recent years. Generations of newcomers have come from the four corners of the globe, contributing to our prosperity, diversity and culture. I’m proud to say that I myself was one of those newcomers. Immigration has been, and will continue to be, a cornerstone of Canada’s success.  It strengthens our country and helps keep Canada globally competitive by spurring innovation and economic growth, and supporting diverse and inclusive communities. It'll help us to ease the great challenges of the coming years, such as the slowing labour force growth and labour shortages linked to Canada's aging population. For example, in 1971 there were 6.6 people of working age for each senior. By 2012 that ratio of worker to retiree had dropped to 4.1 to one. And projections put the ratio at two to one by 2036, less than 20 years from now. Five million Canadians are set to retire by then. And in two decades, almost 100 percent of Canada's net annual population growth will be through immigration. It already accounts for 75 percent of that growth today. If we're able – if we're going to be able to commit to keep our commitments for health care, for pensions, and all of our other social programs, and to continue to grow our economy and meet our labour market needs, in the decades to come we must respond to this clear demographic challenge.In that spirit, our new multi-year immigration levels plan builds on our already historically high immigration levels. This ambitious plan will benefit all Canadians because immigrants contribute to our economic growth and keep our country competitive in a global economy.These unprecedented plans will benefit all Canadians because immigrants contribute to our economic growth and help keep Canada at the forefront of the global economy.  Immigrants drive innovation and help employers meet labour market needs. Higher immigration levels will also improve the operations of our immigration system by helping us to reduce and eliminate immigration backlogs and improve processing times for all our clients. This will help us to reunite families faster; it'll help employers to be able to get the talent that they need here faster; and yes, it'll also help us to provide more protection to the most vulnerable people in the world.Our commitment to eliminating backlogs and reducing processing times is already evident in the last two years. When we took over government, we saw that the spousal program, for example, spouses and children had to wait for 26 months or more to be reunited. We reduced that processing time to 12 months or less. We also, while we were doing that, eliminated 20,000 cases from the spousal backlog. That means 20,000 families are now reunited because of our policies. Citizenship processing used to take 24 months or more when we took over office; citizenship is now taking 12 months or less. We're committed to continuing to eliminate the backlogs and keep working harder to improve client service because that remains a top priority for our government.And to be blunt, Canada is in a unique position now to leverage what some are calling our immigration advantage. And as can be seen in the global environment, there are more and more countries that are closing their doors to people, they're closing their doors to talent, to skills, and yes, to those who are seeking protection from persecution. We are emphatically and unapologetically taking the opposite approach. We welcome the innovation, the innovative perspectives, the entrepreneurial spirits, and the unique skill sets of skilled newcomers. Immigration stands to be an economic difference maker for Canada, both for our current needs but also in the long term. That is why 60 percent of the growth in the immigration levels plan that I'm announcing today over the next three years will come through our economic immigration programs.Prominent among these programs is the Provincial Nominee Program, which helps meet regional labour market needs and distributes the benefits of immigration all across our country. I heard very loud and clear and unanimously from provinces and territories about the importance of the Provincial Nominee Program to particular regional labour market needs and how the Provincial Nominee Program has been a great success for provinces and how they would like to see growth in that program. As well, the number of skilled immigrants we select through the federal Express Entry System will grow over the next three years, which will mean that more highly skilled talent will be able to arrive in our country faster for our labour markets.At the same time, as someone who was a former refugee, I'm proud of the fact that our government will continue to uphold our humanitarian traditions and maintain Canada's leadership role, global role in resettling refugees and offering protection to the most vulnerable. Our commitment to providing protection to the world's most vulnerable people is fundamental to our identity as Canadians and helps us meet our international obligations, thereby securing our international reputation. Indeed, for example, Canada's unique Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program has recently been identified by a number of countries as a model for them and as a potential key element in the international effort to create more resettlement spaces for refugees.Our model is now being used by other countries. For example, I had the great pleasure of going to the United Kingdom to launch the UK Community Sponsorship Program, which is modelled after the Canadian Private Sponsorship Program of Refugees. Other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany, and Australia, are seriously considering this program. We're proud that our model can be a foundation for other countries to support the most vulnerable people.As we increase our immigration levels over the next few years, we'll continue to ensure that our immigration system remains well managed and operates with the safety and security of all Canadians as a top priority. In fact, the adoption of a multi-year planning approach helps us, and our key partners, better plan to meet the challenges and opportunities of immigration growth. And Canada stands out among all immigrant-receiving countries in the great emphasis that we place on assisting newcomers to integrate quickly into our country. Canada stands out as a country that welcomes immigrants and invests in newcomers to help in their transition after they immigrate.  Our settlement services, such as our recently expanded pre-arrival services, language training, employment supports, and newcomer orientation courses, are linked to immigrant success. For example, 93 percent of newcomers who use the settlement services are able to capture and learn English or French, and more than 85 percent pursue citizenship. Initiatives have been implemented to take on emerging challenges in supporting newcomer youth, for example. We, as part of Budget 2017, launched a 27.5 million targeted employment strategy for skilled, professional newcomers, which allows them to start the licensing process before they even arrive in Canada, and helps them to make that transition to their profession once they arrive here.We have made record investments every year for the last two years in settlement and integration funding to support newcomers to integrate into Canada because we know that those investments will pay back so much more. And the faster we can enable that newcomer to restart their life in Canada, the faster that they can contribute to our society. This is precisely why this historic growth is being managed through a gradual increase over three years. This will allow our settlement and integration partners the time that they need to plan and work with all levels of government to ensure that our world-class results for newcomers continue.An increasing number of people we select for immigration are already here – temporary foreign workers, international students. These are excellent candidates for permanent residency because they've already formed an attachment to Canada; they know our country well; they speak one, if not both, of our official languages; and, generally have work experience. So we have confidence that they will integrate well.Canada also stands out by emphasizing that citizenship is the end point in a continuum that begins with settlement and continues with integration. Indeed, most people, about 85 percent, who are eligible to become Canadian citizens take up that citizenship. We believe that welcoming immigrants to Canada, helping them settle and integrate into our society, and ultimately seeing them become Canadian citizens provides our country with great opportunities and a competitive advantage. And as I have travelled across the country since being named to cabinet, I heard a similar message from a variety of stakeholders, including businesses, employers, labour leaders, provincial and territorial representatives, municipal leaders, families, and advocates. They've all said that increased immigration is necessary to ensure economic growth, community sustainability, and keeping Canada globally competitive.Canada has a tremendous opportunity to leverage our strong, well-managed immigration system, our welcoming society in support of our country's future. This historic, multi-year levels plan will help us to do so by addressing the impact of our aging population, by supporting economic growth and innovation, by meeting our real labour market and skills shortages, by reinforcing our global leadership on immigration, and by upholding our humanitarian commitments.Thank you very much. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. \n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is announcing its plan to issue its inaugural Canadian-dollar-denominated green bond this week, subject to market conditions. This follows the release of Canada’s Green Bond Framework on March 3, 2022. The inaugural green bond—the first of many such issuances—will create new financing opportunities that will speed up projects ranging from green infrastructure to nature conservancy, while also growing Canada’s economy and creating new, good-paying jobs across the country. A healthy environment and a healthy economy go hand in hand – and sustainable finance plays a key role in accelerating the transition to a cleaner, greener economy. Mobilizing capital will be crucial to Canada meeting both its 2030 emissions reduction target and its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Government of Canada green bonds will meet the demand of investors seeking green investment opportunities that benefit from Canada’s triple-A credit rating from most major credit rating agencies, while contributing to the development of a stronger sustainable finance market in Canada.\n",

      "News Release Text: Announced by Minister Terry Beech, Minister Rob Fleming, Mayor Ken Sim, and TransLink CEO Kevin Quinn, this project will maintain TOH infrastructure, which connects trolley cars to overhead wires, and support the longevity of trolley bus service in Vancouver and Burnaby. Trolley bus service has been an integral part of zero-emission transit in Metro Vancouver for the past 75 years. Trolley buses replace conventional diesel buses, saving over 18,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually while providing a clean public transit option in the region. The replacement of aging components is essential to keeping TOH infrastructure in good shape and keeping trolley buses moving on the street. This funding will help replace a variety of components that make up the TOH infrastructure, including up to 600 steel trolley poles, approximately 60 km of running wire, and up to 6,000 m of underground cable. Other assets like switch assemblies and hanger and ear units will also be replaced. The project aligns with the Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Vision, TransLink’s Investment Plan, and shared environmental goals by ensuring that existing infrastructure meets quality and safety requirements in order to support trolley bus ridership and reduce GHG emissions. This investment in public transit will also help make these communities more inclusive and enhances the quality of life for users of these services by making it easier for them to get around. \n",

This collaborative project will take Lucent BioSciences’ proprietary technology for “micronutrient fertilizers” to the manufacturing stage with partners AGT Food and Ingredients and 4D Labs, a research facility at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby. Project partners Lucent and AGT met at a supercluster-supported agriculture event a year ago in Regina —an example of how superclusters are creating new opportunities for collaboration. Lucent, an SME, pitched at the event, where Murad Al-Katib, CEO of AGT Food, was a judge. Mr. Al-Katib is one of the founders of the Canadian plant protein industry and, as current chair of the Agri-Food Economic Strategy Table, is part of an unprecedented collaboration between industry and government focused on turning Canadian economic strengths into global advantages.\n",

The Canadian Pride Citation is an individual reconciliation and recognition measure that will be awarded to class members in recognition of their service to Canada and the hardships endured due to unjust policies. It is a meaningful step in the journey of collective reconciliation, recognition and remembrance. The design of the Canada Pride Citation is rich in symbolism. The central maple leaf represents Canada and service to the country. The double-arrow shape represents the importance of remembering the past and the injustice done to LGBTQ2 Canadians working within the federal public service, the Canadian Armed Forces or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It also represents Canada’s commitment towards the future and building a better society where all are valued equally. It is a symbol of hope. The eight colours depicted on both the pin and insignia are a recognized symbol of the LGBTQ2 community. The original Pride flag was created in 1978 and each colour was chosen to represent specific values. Pink represents sexuality, red represents life, orange symbolizes healing, and yellow is sunlight. The green chevron stands for nature, the turquoise represents art, indigo is serenity and violet represents the human spirit.\n",

The federal government is providing more than $26.2 million for this project and the City of Iqaluit is providing over $8.7 million. Federal funding for the City of Iqaluit’s new Solid Waste Facilities project comes from the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan, which is being delivered in Nunavut through an Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Nunavut. This project includes replacing the City’s existing landfill, which has reached the end of its useful life. Thanks to this investment, the City of Iqaluit will construct a new landfill that is essential to the health and safety of the community and the protection of the surrounding environment. The project includes the development of a new recycling and eco-centre, composting, and new methods of waste collection for residential, commercial and industrial waste. Funding will also be used for the construction of a road to the landfill and the decommissioning of the existing site. This much anticipated project will help improve the efficiency and standard of solid waste management in Iqaluit while reducing the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions, and improving the City’s air quality. \n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is taking the next step in rehabilitating and greening its heating and cooling plants in the National Capital Region by launching a procurement process to identify the top 3 private partners capable of providing superior and innovative proposals. The government is looking for interested parties to participate in the Request for Qualifications for the modernization of the district energy system that currently heats and cools over 80 buildings in the National Capital Region, including the Parliament Buildings. This procurement process will result in a public-private partnership, where the private partner will be responsible for designing and building a more modern and efficient energy system, while exploring the feasibility of using alternative low- or no-carbon sources of energy to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The partner will also be responsible for the short-term financing of the construction and for the long-term operation and maintenance of the assets.  Candidates will be evaluated on their qualifications to carry out the extensive modernization based on their experience in projects of similar size and complexity. The submission deadline is November 1, 2017. The 3 pre-qualified candidates will be invited to submit technical and financial proposals for the project through a Request for Proposal process in early 2018. A contract is expected to be finalized with the successful private partner in the spring 2019. The Energy Services Acquisition Program is part of the government’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while creating jobs for the middle class and supporting the clean-tech industry.\n",

      "News Release Text: Today, the Commission announced its decision to amend the waste facility decommissioning licence issued to Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd. (CNL) for its Douglas Point Waste Facility, located in Tiverton, Ontario. This decision follows a public hearing held virtually on November 25 and 26, 2020. The amended licence allows CNL to undertake Phase 3 active decommissioning activities, including the decommissioning and dismantlement of certain facilities and structures at the facility. In making its decision, the Commission considered oral and written submissions from CNL, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) staff and 21 intervenors. The Commission also made participant funding available through the CNSC’s Participant Funding Program and invited interventions from Indigenous groups, members of the public and stakeholders in this matter. Seven requesters received participant funding to assist with interventions. After reviewing all submissions, the Commission concluded that CNL is qualified to carry out the decommissioning activities for Phase 3, which the amended licence will authorize. It also concluded that CNL will make adequate provisions for the protection of the environment, and the health and safety of persons. The record of decision is available on request to the Commission Secretariat at cnsc.interventions.ccsn@canada.ca. The decision will also be posted in both official languages on nuclearsafety.gc.ca at a later date. All submissions, hearing transcripts and the hearing webcast are available on the CNSC website. The CNSC regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials in order to protect the health, safety and security of Canadians and the environment. The CNSC is also mandated to implement Canada’s international commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public. -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: Newcomer women who are members of a visible minority group may face multiple barriers to success, including gender- and race-based discrimination, precarious or low income employment, lack of affordable childcare and weak social supports. Recognizing these challenges, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is providing additional funding of up to $5 million to 10 service provider organizations across Canada over the next 3 years to increase employment supports and services for newcomer women. The Association for New Canadians provides employment-related services such as counselling, networking and mentoring, as well as employment-focused information and orientation sessions. The association has a proven track record and experience delivering women-focused programming. This additional funding of $290,000 will support the organization in serving more visible minority newcomer women in the area. Identifying IRCC-funded service providers that are already offering strong programming for women and giving them additional funding will provide an immediate boost in capacity to support visible minority newcomer women. Today’s funding announcement is part of IRCC’s 3-year Visible Minority Newcomer Women Pilot, which also includes establishing new partnerships with organizations for women. On December 5, IRCC launched an expression of interest process for new partnerships with organizations for women not currently funded by the department. IRCC will provide up to $7 million in funding over the next 3 years for new, innovative programs and services to support visible minority women in accessing the labour market and to build capacity in smaller organizations that serve or are led by visible minority women.\n",

      "News Release Text: International collaboration is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring a strong, resilient, sustainable, and inclusive economic recovery guided by a rules-based international trading system. Today, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, participated in the G7 Trade and Investment Ministers’ Meeting, hosted by Liz Truss, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for International Trade. At the meeting, the G7 ministers agreed to redouble efforts on the accelerated production and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and to take decisive steps to ensure that the WTO is prepared to respond to future trade and health challenges. This includes support for the United Kingdom’s workplan under its 2021 G7 Presidency to enhance the capacity of the global trading system to respond to public health emergencies.  Minister Ng noted the important work underway in the Trade and Health Initiative at the WTO, spearheaded by the Ottawa Group for WTO Reform. Minister Ng reiterated Canada’s continued engagement with other G7 countries on WTO reform in advance of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference in November 2021. This includes strengthening WTO rules to address trade-distorting practices, improving transparency, delivering a timely conclusion of fisheries subsidies negotiations, and providing for effective WTO dispute settlement. Minister Ng also emphasized the importance of G7 members working together to modernize digital trade rules to support an inclusive economic recovery that leaves no one behind and to ensure that global supply chains are free from goods produced by forced labour. Throughout the two-day event, Minister Ng also highlighted the importance of rules-based trade and WTO initiatives in supporting coordinated global climate change action and in ensuring a sustainable future economy. In exchanges with her G7 counterparts, Minister Ng emphasized the importance of fostering greater participation in global trade by under-represented groups, including women, Indigenous businesses, racialized entrepreneurs, and small and medium-sized enterprises. Minister Ng encouraged broader G7 participation in two initiatives championed by Canada: the WTO trade and gender workplan, and the Global Trade and Gender Arrangement, both of which promote the greater participation of women in trade and will be crucial in advancing economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The G7 trade and investment ministers agreed to meet again in October 2021 to make further progress on key initiatives in advance of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference.\n",

      "News Release Text: Last year was the best year ever for tourism in Canada, as we welcomed a record of 20.8 million international visitors to our shores. The tourism industry is an important economic driver in our communities, as one in 10 jobs in Canada is associated with the visitor economy. Investing in tourism projects in both big cities and small towns throughout Atlantic Canada is essential to growing this important economic sector for Canadians. By investing in our tourism sector, we attract new visitors, grow businesses and create new ones, generating economic growth for the middle class. Thanks to investments by the federal and provincial governments, the Miramichi River Tourism Association will implement a strategic marketing plan to boost tourism throughout the region. To celebrate Tourism Week , Pat Finnigan, Member of Parliament for Miramichi-Grand Lake,  on behalf of the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development and Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), and the Honourable Bardish Chagger, Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Minister of Small Business and Tourism, along with the Hon. Bill Fraser, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure and minister responsible for the Regional Development Corporation made the announcement today. The investment will support the overall implementation of a plan to boost tourism in the region, with a focus on exploring product and experience development for the Miramichi region’s regular season, piloting a shoulder season, and developing a food strategy.  The Government of Canada is providing a contribution of $129,957 through ACOA’s Business Development Program, while the Province of New Brunswick is investing $81,000 through the Regional Development Corporation.This investment reflects the Government of Canada and the four Atlantic Provinces’ commitment to drive economic growth in the region through the Atlantic Growth Strategy by helping the region’s tourism industry attract more visitors and create new jobs across the region. This bold new approach is in line with Canada’s Tourism Vision, which seeks to make Canada a top-ten global tourism destination by 2025. Today’s announcement comes as Canada celebrates Tourism Week from May 27 to June 2, 2018.\n",

      "Location: Alberta\n",
      "News Release Text: In lieu of an in-person update to the media, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, issued the following statement today: “As the resurgence of COVID-19 activity continues in Canada, we are tracking a range of epidemiological indicators to monitor where the disease is most active, where it is spreading and how it is impacting the health of Canadians and public health, laboratory and healthcare capacity. The following is the latest summary on national numbers and trends, and the actions we all need to be taking to maintain COVID-19 at manageable levels across the country. Since the first cases were reported in March 2020, there have been 198,148 cases of COVID-19, including 9,760 deaths reported in Canada; these cumulative numbers tell us about the overall burden of COVID-19 illness to date. Though the numbers are high and continue to increase at an accelerated pace, it is important to remember that the vast majority of Canadians remain susceptible to COVID-19. Hence, we all need to continue with individual precautions to keep ourselves, our families and our communities safer.   Currently, cases of COVID-19 continue to increase across the country. At this time, there are 21,276 active cases across the country and the latest national-level data indicate daily averages of 2,284 new cases (Oct 10-16) and 77,000 people tested, with 2.4% testing positive (Sep 27-Oct 3*).    The number of people experiencing severe illness is also increasing. Provincial and territorial data, indicate that an average of 893 people with COVID-19 were being treated in Canadian hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (Oct 10-16), including 178 of whom were being treated in intensive care units. During the same period, there were an average of 20 COVID-19-related deaths reported daily. As hospitalisations and deaths tend to lag behind increased disease activity by one to several weeks, the concern is that we have yet to see the extent of severe impacts associated with the ongoing increase in COVID-19 disease activity. As well, we are entering flu season, a time when hospitals generally see increased activity due to influenza and to other respiratory infections. This is why it is so important for people of all ages to keep up with public health practices that keep the infection rate low. Our primary goal for the pandemic response remains to minimise severe illness and deaths due to COVID-19. Public health is focussed on making the response sustainable through to the end of the pandemic while balancing the health, social and economic consequences. But public health cannot do this alone; this response requires a collective effort. We must keep our number of in-person close contacts low and adhere to proven effective public health practices, including self-isolating at home if you are experiencing any symptoms, maintaining physical distancing, wearing a face mask as appropriate and keeping up with hand, cough and surface hygiene. Read my backgrounder to access more COVID-19 Information and Resources on ways to reduce the risks and protect yourself and others. Finally, please plan to get your flu shot as soon as it becomes available in your area. You can get a flu shot at a flu clinic near you, a pharmacy that offers the flu shot, or by contacting your local public health unit to find other available options in your area.” * The latest data for laboratory testing, for the period Oct 4-10 excludes data for Alberta due to a data standardisation issue that is currently being addressed. These data indicate that an average of over 68,000 people are being tested in provinces and territories outside Alberta, with 2.8 testing positive. This is an underestimate of the number of people being tested nationally and may be an over estimate of the percentage positive of people testing positive nationally.\n",

This was one of the largest single mass killings of Jewish people during the Holocaust. During a commemorative event at the site of the Babyn Yar massacre today, the Honourable Stéphane Dion, Special Envoy to the European Union and Europe and Ambassador to Germany, stood alongside world leaders to reaffirm Canada’s commitment to combatting antisemitism and all forms of hate. We honour the memory of those who have perished, as well as the survivors, whose stories serve as a solemn reminder of the dangers of indifference and inaction in the face of hatred. Babyn Yar is also a reminder of our individual and collective responsibilities to remember, to bear witness, to prevent and act against antisemitism and mass atrocity.  “Today, antisemitism is still very much alive. While its new and resurgent forms have changed the way that we fight against this warped ideology, Canada remains unwavering in its commitment to challenge antisemitism at home and abroad and to build more just and inclusive societies. “The Government of Canada is committed to reinforcing and strengthening Canada’s efforts to advance Holocaust education, remembrance and research, and to combat antisemitism as key elements of the promotion and protection of human rights at home and abroad. “The Government of Canada stands in solidarity with more than 390,000 members of the Jewish community in Canada and millions more across the globe, to echo these sentiments.

Now is the time to put armed conflict on lockdown, to protect the most vulnerable and to focus our efforts together in the fight against this virus. We are proud to have led 58 countries in supporting the Secretary-General’s appeal, and we encourage all countries to do the same. “As COVID-19 continues to spread, Canada is particularly concerned about the plight of women, children and vulnerable civilians caught in armed conflict and humanitarian crises. We know that these populations are already disproportionately affected by armed conflict, that they are more vulnerable to economic and food insecurity and that they are at even greater risk now because of this pandemic. This is why a global ceasefire is so important. “Canada is working hard to prioritize the protection of the most vulnerable in the response to the pandemic, including through our most recent funding of the UN system and international partners. We offer Canada’s full support to, and stand in solidarity with, those on the front lines of the response and the civilians and vulnerable populations in conflict, who require protection now more than ever. During this unprecedented global crisis, we also wish to reiterate Canada’s full commitment to multilateralism and the rules-based international order.”\n",

      "News Release Text: The Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement: “Canada welcomes the adoption of the UN Human Rights Council’s (UNHRC) resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. “Today’s resolution represents the international community’s continued support for ensuring reconciliation, accountability and respect for human rights in Sri Lanka. Canada, as part of the Core Group on this resolution, worked alongside members of the council for the passage of this resolution. The Human Rights council plays a key role in preventing future serious violations, as well as in addressing those of the past. The new resolution advances accountability in Sri Lanka by mandating the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ‘to collect, consolidate, analyse and preserve information and evidence’ of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law. This mandate will be critical for future accountability processes. The continued reporting and the attention of the UNHRC will assist in monitoring ongoing human rights concerns in the country. “Canada will continue to urge Sri Lanka to uphold its human rights obligations, end impunity and undertake a comprehensive accountability process for all violations and abuses of human rights. Canada believes the resolution is a step toward securing a safe, peaceful and inclusive future for Sri Lanka, and, to this end, we stand ready to support efforts that work towards this goal.”\n",

      "News Release Text: With the longest coastline in the world, keeping our oceans safe and clean is a top priority for the Government of Canada. Since its launch in 2016, the Oceans Protection Plan—the largest investment ever made to protect our oceans and keep our coastlines clean—has led to over 50 initiatives and the completion of more than 300 projects to keep our waters safe and clean from coast-to-coast-to-coast. To build on this investment in our oceans, today the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, announced over $1.2 billion for 29 initiatives as part of the next phase of the Oceans Protection Plan. This investment includes $890.3 million for 19 initiatives to strengthen Canada’s marine safety and prevention response. An investment of $337.3 million will be provided for 10 initiatives to support measures that build partnerships between the Government of Canada and Indigenous and coastal communities to better protect our waters. Since 2016, under the Oceans Protection Plan, the Government of Canada has invested in scientific research and solutions to help make our response to marine incidents—especially oil spills—more efficient and comprehensive. Investments announced today will continue to advance this work and expand it to more areas, including: The Government of Canada is committed to continuing to work meaningfully with First Nations, Inuit, Métis, and coastal communities in delivering the Oceans Protection Plan and respecting the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. Today’s funding announcement aims to continue advancing this work, and offers new opportunities for Indigenous Peoples and coastal communities to: The Oceans Protection Plan is a Canadian success story. When Indigenous Peoples, industry, communities, scientists, and government work together to protect our environment, grow our economy, and support good jobs across the country, we deliver real results. This renewed and expanded Oceans Protection Plan will keep our oceans and coasts safe and healthy; will advance reconciliation, and build a clean future for our children and grandchildren.\n",

      "News Release Text: Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) is closely monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases reported in First Nations communities across the country. Overall, case numbers continue to decline, with 1,383 active cases reported as of February 16, 2021. First Nation communities in the Atlantic region have not reported a new case since January 25. With new COVID-19 variants on the rise, it is critical that everyone continue with physical distancing, wearing masks, avoiding gatherings and non-essential travel, staying home when sick, and keeping up with frequent hand, cough and surface hygiene. The combination of all these public health measures are required to stop the spread of the virus. In First Nations communities, as of February 16, ISC is aware of: There are a total of 47 confirmed positive cases in Nunavik, Quebec, and all but 7 have recovered. As of February 16, the Government of Nunavut is reporting 23 active cases in the Kivalliq Region, and a total of 323 confirmed cases of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Of the 323 reported cases, 299 people have recovered from the virus. As of February 11, 2021, more than 1.4 million Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have been distributed across the country. As of February 16, 2021, more than 83,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in more than 400 First Nations, Inuit and Territorial communities, reaching 27 per cent of the community adult population at a rate that’s over 6 times that of Canada’s. We expect that the number of communities with vaccinations underway will continue to increase in the coming weeks, as vaccine supply ramps up. Some people also report experiencing more side effects after the second dose. Side effects such as pain, redness or swelling where the needle was given, mild fever, tiredness, and muscle or joint aches  are to be expected, and often go away on their own without treatment. Though these side effects may be uncomfortable in the short term, they indicate that the body is building immunity. Receiving both doses is critical in ensuring maximum effectiveness of the vaccine. Canada is expected to receive 6 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the end of March. Canada will now receive 2.8 million additional doses of Pfizer-BioNTech between April and June, and an additional 6.2 million doses between July and September than was originally scheduled. The Government of Canada has also purchased an additional 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, bringing the total number of secured doses to 44 million. Canada is now expected to receive 84 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the end of September 2021. A number of federal partners, including the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), ISC and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, continue to work in collaboration with communities, provinces and territories in an effort to assess on-going community needs, and supports. Currently, the CAF is on the ground in several First Nation communities including the Pauingassi First Nation in Manitoba, the Fort Nelson First Nation in British Columbia, the Hatchet Lake First Nation in Saskatchewan and the Muskrat Dam Lake First Nation in Ontario to help communities manage COVID-19 outbreaks and vaccine distribution. The Government of Canada continues to develop tools to assist health care providers, communities and partners in their efforts to encourage uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Public Health Agency of Canada recently released a new tool kit for health care providers to equip them with information and resources to help their patients and colleagues make informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccination. As well, ISC created public service announcement scripts on the COVID-19 vaccine in 17 different Indigenous languages for communities and groups to use in their outreach and engagement efforts. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization’s new guidance recommends that all Indigenous adults be prioritized for immunization. As we work to support vaccine administration in Indigenous communities, we are also supporting the vaccine roll out for  Indigenous adults living in cities and towns across Canada. To this end, ISC is working closely with provinces and territories, First Nation, Inuit and Métis partners, the National Association of Friendship Centres, and other urban community service organizations to support planning efforts. This includes working to identify barriers, challenges and opportunities for increasing vaccine uptake and ensuring the vaccine is available in culturally safe and accessible locations. Last week, a COVID-19 pop-up vaccination site in Winnipeg focused on immunizing First Nations health-care workers, knowledge keepers and traditional healers. In addition, the Government of Ontario announced, this past weekend, that Indigenous adults have been identified as a priority group for vaccination in Phase One. Some Aboriginal Health Access Centres across Ontario have already started rolling out vaccines, including at the Wabano Centre in Ottawa. The Akausivik Inuit Family Health Team in Ottawa is also starting their vaccination program this week. ISC continues to support Indigenous communities impacted by COVID-19 through partnerships and other innovative solutions. In some communities, ISC is supporting community leadership on addictions and mental health gaps, in addition to working with federal and provincial partners to identify alternative isolation centres for community members that test positive. ISC also continues to support communities by actively sending personal protective equipment and working with community health services to provide surge capacity and testing. More than $4.2 billion has been announced in COVID-19 support to Indigenous and northern communities and organizations, including $926.7 million for the ongoing public health response to COVID-19 in Indigenous communities.\n",

      "News Release Text: The quality of Canada’s transportation infrastructure and the efficiency of the country’s trade corridors are key to the success of Canadian firms in the global marketplace. The Government of Canada supports infrastructure projects that create quality middle-class jobs and boost economic growth.             Today, the Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport, announced a major investment of  $167 million for three projects that will help Canadian businesses compete globally by making improvements to port infrastructure and by increasing the capacity of the rail infrastructure that serves the south shore port area, ensuring goods move efficiently to market. The first two projects are led by the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, with investment from Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway and include: The third project led by Canadian National, with investment from the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, involves designing and building a 4.2 kilometre-long secondary track, parallel to the existing Burrard Inlet line, in the City of Vancouver. The increased rail capacity will support the flow of goods through the south shore port area, as trade volumes continue to grow. The projects will increase the efficiency and capacity of the rail network servicing the north and south shores of the Port of Vancouver, while also facilitating the movement of goods and reducing the effects of rail traffic on the community. In addition, these projects will improve safety with better access to and from the south shore waterfront. The Government of Canada is supporting infrastructure projects that contribute most to Canada’s continued success in international trade. For example, projects being funded will: Provincial, territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous groups, not-for-profit and for-profit private-sector organizations, federal Crown Corporations, Canadian Port Authorities, and National Airport System Airport Authorities are all eligible for funding under the National Trade Corridors Fund.\n",

      "News Release Text: March 29, 2021 | Ottawa, Ontario | Health Canada In many areas across Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic has tragically worsened the ongoing health crisis of opioid-related harms and deaths. People who use drugs continue to face barriers and risks related to the toxicity of the illegal drug supply and reduced access to health and social services, including life-saving harm reduction and treatment. Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, announced $20 million in funding for the distribution of naloxone kits and opioid overdose response training to support communities that have been particularly affected by the opioid overdose crisis and are experiencing challenges in improving health outcomes of their residents. These include individuals living in rural and remote areas, Indigenous peoples, Northern residents, people experiencing homelessness, youth in communities at increased risk of opioid-related harms, and working-aged men.  The funded projects will be led by the Advanced Coronary Treatment (ACT) Foundation of Canada, the Canadian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance. These organizations play a key role in building awareness of opioids and substance use, including the signs of an overdose and the steps to take to help save a life. Additionally, the projects will provide education and training on how to administer naloxone and will increase access and distribution of naloxone kits in communities that need them the most. These new initiatives will supplement existing provincial and territorial take-home naloxone efforts. The Government of Canada continues to collaborate with all levels of government, partners, stakeholders, people with lived and living experience of substance use, and organizations in communities across the country in its public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and overdose crisis.\n",

      "News Release Text: July 18, 2018                   Point Pelee National Park, ON                     Parks Canada Agency The Government of Canada wants all Canadians to experience and discover Canada’s rich history and to help preserve our amazing natural and cultural heritage. In 2018, Parks Canada will be hosting BioBlitz events at various locations across the country including a BioBlitz at Point Pelee National Park from July 21 to 22. A BioBlitz is a fun and educational activity that allows participants to team up with scientists to experience the outdoors, discover plant and animal species, and contribute to their protection. It is a team effort to find as many different life forms as possible. At this time of year, many groups of plants and critters are visible and it’s a great time to discover the incredible biodiversity of Point Pelee National Park. To help commemorate Point Pelee National Park's 100 years of conservation and even longer history of ecological study and environmental stewardship, participants are invited to join the first ever “all park, all species” Point Pelee 100 BioBlitz.  As part of Parks Day, the park's resource conservation staff will be joined by nature experts and naturalists to conduct a 24-hour, all-park search aimed at documenting every species in the park, starting at 12:00 p.m. on July 21. BioBlitz participants are invited to join experts for talks and hikes on different groups of species found in the park. They can also partake in their own species survey with the use of the iNaturalist app on their personal iPhone or Android device. Canadians and visitors are encouraged to get involved by supporting local conservation efforts through BioBlitz events. Parks Canada is actively working with partners, including Indigenous peoples, to monitor and restore ecosystems, protect species at risk, and expand our knowledge of biodiversity and climate change. Preserving and promoting ecological integrity is a priority for Parks Canada and the Government of Canada has committed to protecting 17 per cent of land and inland waters, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine waters by 2020. BioBlitz events are an opportunity to get involved in helping to protect the environment and Canada’s biodiversity. Please visit the Parks Canada website for a full list of BioBlitz events, and make conservation part of your plans for 2018. Over the past three years, BioBlitz participants across the country have counted approximately 42 species at risk including observing monarch butterflies and caterpillars!

      "News Release Text: Canadians rely on safe and well-maintained local and regional airports to support vibrant communities. These airports also support essential air services including community resupply, air ambulance, search and rescue, and forest fire response. Wayne Long, Member of Parliament for Saint John—Rothesay, on behalf of the Minister of Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, today announced that the Government of Canada is making important safety investments at the Saint John Airport. Through Transport Canada’s Airports Capital Assistance Program (ACAP), the Government of Canada will provide the airport with more than $1.8 million to purchase critical safety equipment including: This equipment will help maintain safe airport operations for aircraft, passengers, crews and airport workers. This funding is in addition to the more than $500,000 in Airports Capital Assistance Program funding provided to the airport in May 2021, to support the rehabilitation of airside apron floodlighting and electrical constant current regulators. Since the Airports Capital Assistance Program started in 1995, the Government of Canada has invested over $1.2 billion for 1,215 projects at 199 local, regional and smaller National Airports System airports across the country.

      "News Release Text: Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia People in Halifax and communities across Canada deserve to feel safe in their communities. That’s why the Government of Canada is taking action with a comprehensive plan that gets guns off our streets and puts more resources into our communities. An important element of this work is stopping violence before it starts, which is why the government launched the $250 million Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF). First announced in March 2022, the BSCF supports local initiatives that prevent gun and gang violence and help young people make good choices. Today the Honourable Marco Mendicino, Minister of Public Safety, announced that the Halifax Regional Municipality will receive up to $3.3 million from the BSCF to prevent gun crime and gang violence in the region. This funding will help address the underlying conditions that give rise to crime. The municipality will distribute it to community-led projects for young people involved in gangs or at risk of joining them – helping them set themselves up for success in life. No single program or initiative can tackle the challenge of gun crime on its own. The BSCF is one of many elements in the Government’s plan to keep Canadians safe. Our work begins at Canada’s borders, where we’ve added resources to fight smuggling and stop guns from coming into the country. The Government banned assault-style firearms like the AR-15 two years ago and will soon begin a buyback program to get these guns out of our communities. Last October, a national freeze on handguns was implemented . Finally, we recently introduced Bill C-21 – Canada’s most significant action on gun violence in a generation. In addition to the handgun freeze, it proposes significant provisions to combat organized crime and address the alarming role of guns in domestic violence.           \n",

      "News Release Text: Check against delivery Good morning and welcome everyone.Let me begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee [howden oh SAWnee], and, most recently, the territory of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, who are represented here today.Thank you Elder Peter Schuler for your participation in these opening ceremonies.Today is very special for me. It is my first speech as minister of Health, and I am very glad its focus is Mental Health. This is an issue that is near and dear to me.You know – When the Prime Minister asked me to take on this role, I was impressed by the portfolio, even more so because of its impact on Mental Health. To be honest, the very first thing that came to mind was how much I looked forward to building on the work done by my predecessor Jane Philpott in this area.Some of you may know that I’m a career social worker. I dedicated 25 years to working in the community and helping with issues first responders deal with every day. These experiences taught me one very important lesson: that collaboration with service providers is essential to better care for patients.  In my role, I look forward to taking part in events like today, that provide important opportunities for diverse groups of professionals to come together and take a moment to reflect on what’s being done across the country, to discuss how we can remove barriers to access, and share some of the innovative ways in which we can tackle mental illness.I was proud to provide counselling to people who were victims of crime, particularly where trauma was apparent. In these decades I learned and shared the values of compassion with my colleagues and worked to break the stigma that is often associated with mental health.I also volunteered with several organizations dedicated to helping victims of crime and people struggling with mental illness. This included the Canadian Mental Health Association’s Suicide Prevention Committee in Moncton.Through my work and my time as a volunteer, I saw first-hand the effects of trauma, stigma and problematic substance use on individuals.But I also saw that some of these same individuals—when provided with appropriate supports and services—can survive and ultimately thrive.Today, I would like to focus on three themes:   1. Discuss the state of mental health in Canada, both nationally and, more particularly, in Indigenous communities.   2. Share what the Government of Canada is doing to help Canadians access mental health supports and to address social inequities that influence health.   3. Call upon all of us to help end the stigma of mental illness, which prevents many from seeking help. 1- Current state of mental healthWhen it comes to mental health, the Canadian landscape is grim:   • More than 10 Canadians die by suicide each day.   • 1 in 3 Canadians report having experienced some form of maltreatment as a child-including physical abuse, sexual abuse or exposure to violence at home.        o In fact, family violence accounts for more than a quarter of violent crimes reported to police.   • Mental health issues affect not only individuals and families, but communities and society overall. It is estimated that depression and anxiety cost the Canadian economy almost $50 billion per year in lost productivity.These facts are a stark reminder to all of us of the work that remains…. work that cannot be done alone by any one government department or agency, charitable group or private organization. This is well-reflected in the theme of this conference: “It takes a nation.” I think that all of us — health professionals, social workers, advocates, and people with lived and living experience — would agree that as a country, we need to do more to help those experiencing mental illness.At the same time, we need to acknowledge the progress that we have made. As a society, we’re now speaking openly and frankly about our mental health. We have realized the importance of mental wellness as an indicator of good health, as well as the depth and breadth of the challenges we face and the need for collective action. This elevated level of realization, in and of itself, represents significant strides.I stand before you today as Minister of Health, representing a Government that believes strongly in advancing the work that needs to be done on mental health. Mental illness has come out of the shadows. 2- Actions taken by the Government of CanadaIncreasing access to mental health servicesAs you know, our Government reached agreement with all provinces and territories that will see historic investments in mental health over the next 10 years.We’ve committed $5 billion of new, targeted funding to improve access to mental health and addiction services across Canada. This is the first time that such a significant investment has been dedicated to mental health.The federal government, and the provinces and territories endorsed a Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities, which sets out key areas of action, including on mental health and addictions.I look forward to the next step of these agreements which aims to establish a set of meaningful indicators for Canadians to understand how we are doing with our integration of mental health services.But improving access to mental health services through better integration within the overall health systems is just one part of the solution. We must also address the impact of social determinants of health on Canadians’ mental health. Social determinants of health We know that health, including mental health, is influenced by a number of social, economic and environmental factors—what we call social determinants of health. These factors include housing, education, and access to employment.Our Government understands that we need to reduce poverty, enhance early learning, and increase access to housing.To this end, we are committed to developing a Canadian Poverty Reduction Strategy, to reduce poverty and improve the economic well-being of all Canadian families so that they can have a real and fair chance to succeed.In Budget 2017, we committed $11.2 billion in new funding over 11 years as part of a National Housing Strategy. This strategy is designed to build, renew and repair Canada’s stock of affordable housing and to help ensure that Canadians have housing that meets their needs. Those among us dealing with mental illness are one of the priority groups identified.Our Government introduced the Canada Child Benefit, which provides support to those who need it most, such as single-parent and low-income families. Today, thanks to this initiative, about 300,000 fewer children live below the poverty line.And we are working with provinces and territories, the private sector, and educational institutions to explore new approaches to skills development and innovation.These are just a few examples of our Government’s actions to improve Canadians’ quality of life and, by extension, their mental health. While these are important steps, we know that we must continue to invest in all areas in pursuit of social equity, and that there remains much work to be done.Supports for indigenous peoplesNowhere is the need for social equity more urgent than in Canada’s Indigenous communities.The harsh reality — and one that must change — is that Canada’s Indigenous populations experience undeniable gaps in health and mental health outcomes compared to non-Indigenous Canadians.And for this, the crown must bear a large measure of responsibility. Indigenous people have suffered from both negligence and systemic discrimination, including in their access to health care.This reality has been made worse by poor housing conditions, unemployment, lack of education and community infrastructure, and the legacy of residential schools. Combined, these factors have significantly impacted mental health outcomes in these communities.First Nations youth die by suicide about 5 to 6 times more often than non-Aboriginal youth. The situation is even more dire for Inuit youth, who die by suicide at a rate that is among the highest in the world.To begin to reverse this legacy of neglect and discrimination, Budget 2017 committed $828 million in new investments to improve the health outcomes of First Nations and Inuit.As well, the Prime Minister’s recent decision to create two new departments to better respond to Indigenous issues demonstrates this Government’s resolve to move beyond the structures and institutions of the past that have characterized our relationships with Indigenous peoples to this day.As part of this historic shift in focus, my predecessor at Health Canada, Minister Philpott has been called upon to improve service delivery and reduce the unacceptable health and social inequalities that these communities face. I look forward to working with her in her new role to deliver on our promise to improve the living conditions of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples in Canada.In addition to the yearly investments to fund programs and services to improve mental health for First Nations and Inuit, our Government announced an additional $69 million over three years to support local mental wellness teams, crisis intervention teams, and the First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness Help Line. To date, the Help Line has received more than 2,000 calls.And in Budget 2017, the Government pledged an additional $118.2 million over five years to improve mental health services for First Nations and Inuit.These significant investments build on existing programming within my own Health Portfolio dedicated to promoting mental health among Indigenous populations.  For example, Health Canada provides funding for the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy to support approximately 138 community-based youth suicide prevention projects in First Nations and Inuit communities across Canada.And Health Canada provided $9 million to the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami Suicide Prevention Strategy, which delivers dedicated mental health resources and services to Inuit populations.  The Public Health Agency of Canada supports a range of programs and activities that focus on the factors that lead to positive mental health. For example, maternal and child health programs help build resilience in vulnerable young children and families by supporting positive parenting, family attachment, and healthy relationships. Many of these programs emphasize cultural literacy and support for Indigenous women, children and families.  While existing programs and new investments are an important part of our efforts to redress inequities that have impacted Indigenous peoples for generations, much more needs to be done.Opioid crisisOne additional area that bears acknowledgement in this discussion is the link between mental illness, problematic substance use, and the opioid crisis.While poor mental health is not the only reason behind our current opioid crisis, it is certainly a factor.In 2016, there were more than 2,800 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada. Our most recent data suggest that the number of opioid-related deaths will almost certainly exceed 3,000. To put this in perspective, that’s almost double the number of motor vehicle fatalities in all of Canada for 2014.This is an unacceptable tragedy. These aren’t just numbers; they are people with their own personal story of unaddressed needs. And that is why the federal government is committed to a compassionate, harm-reducing, comprehensive and collaborative approach to the opioid crisis. We will continue to show leadership and work with health professionals, addiction experts, people with lived and living experience, people with chronic pain, provinces, territories and municipalities to address this crisis and the underlying causes of problematic substance use. 3- Reducing stigmaAs with substance use disorder, we need to acknowledge—and work towards ending—the stigma associated with mental health. We would never say to a friend or loved one that they need to “just get over it” when diagnosed with cancer or another disease affecting physical health. So why would it be okay to use that kind of language with someone facing depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or suicidal thoughts?Stigma is a barrier that discourages people from seeking help or from offering support to someone in need.Initiatives such as Bell Let’s Talk are helping to tackle the stigma that surrounds mental health. A 2015 Nielsen survey undertaken on behalf of Bell Let's Talk found that 81% of Canadians were more aware of mental health issues than they were in 2010, and 57% believe the stigma around mental illness has been reduced.I applaud the work of the Mental Health Commission of Canada, which works to support suicide prevention, address problematic substance use, and increase Canadians’ understanding of mental health issues.We are also seeing progress in eliminating the barrier of stigma within the Government. In addition to the initiatives I mentioned earlier, our Government is committed to helping those facing the challenges of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.For example, Veterans Affairs Canada plans to create a new Centre of Excellence in Veterans’ care, specializing in mental health, PTSD and related issues for Veterans.As others have said, mental illness is a sickness, not a weakness.In closing, let me return to our theme today: “It Takes a Nation.” All of us in Canada can and must do more to help improve our collective mental health. We are far from being a world leader in this area. We’re now doubling efforts by working with provinces and territories, and making targeted investments to take better care of Canadians suffering from mental illness.We need to go beyond the health sector to promote mental health in schools, workplaces and communities across Canada. An event like today, is an important opportunity to underscore the positive impact we can all have on each other by listening a little longer, by showing more compassion and by talking openly about mental health.We need to improve access to quality services, and we need to collaborate across regions, professions and jurisdictions to strengthen Canada’s approach to this challenge.I thank the Canadian Mental Health Association for organizing this conference. Today you’re providing a meaningful opportunity for people from across the country to build partnerships and explore sustainable ways to improve mental health and promote mental wellness. I look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead.Thank you all for shining a light on mental illness, facing these challenges head on, and providing hope and recovery to millions of Canadians.Thank you, merci.\n",

      "News Release Text: This week presents an opportunity for individuals, communities and governments to reflect on the work we have done together to promote sexual and reproductive health, and to encourage all Canadians to engage in healthy behaviours. Stigma, discrimination and sexual violence can occur when individuals don’t talk openly about sexual health and don’t have access to vital reproductive and sexual health information. It is so important to create positive and respectful relationships, including relationships between individuals and their health care providers to foster better health outcomes and improve better access to services. The Government of Canada is working closely with the provinces and territories to monitor trends in sexually transmitted infections, which in turn inform policy and health service planning and delivery. We are also working with provinces, territories, communities and other partners to promote comprehensive sexual health education, information and programs that remove the stigma associated with sexual health issues. Building on this collaboration, the Public Health Agency of Canada is convening a conference to discuss sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections on February 23-24, 2017. This will bring together health care practitioners, academics, researchers, provincial and territorial officials and community-based organizations to identify concrete actions that will help Canada to address HIV, Hepatitis B and C and other sexually transmitted infections as public health concerns. This Sexual and Reproductive Health Week, I encourage Canadians to take an active role in protecting their sexual and reproductive health and wellness, by taking the time to get informed and get tested for sexually transmitted infections.

      "News Release Text: Prescription drugs are an important part of Canada’s health care system and can help to enhance the well-being of Canadians. The Government of Canada is taking action to improve the affordability, accessibility and appropriate use of prescription drugs through regulatory improvements, enhanced partnerships and better integration of drug review processes. Today, the Government of Canada published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, proposed changes to the Patented Medicines Regulations, representing the first major update to the regulations in more than 20 years. These proposed amendments to the Regulations are intended to provide the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) with the tools it needs to better protect Canadian consumers from the high prices of patented drugs. Interested parties are invited to provide comments on the proposal within 75 days of publication (February 14). The proposed regulations include a revised list of countries against which Canada’s patented drug prices would be compared, and the introduction of new regulatory factors that the PMPRB would take into consideration when assessing whether a patented drug price is excessive. Changes to these regulations will lower prices for public drug plans and, ultimately, for Canadians. For example, under the current Regulations, drug companies are required to report on only the direct price reductions they offer to Canadian customers at the first point of sale such as wholesalers and pharmacy chains. The amendments would require reporting on all price reductions, so that the PMPRB can take all reductions into consideration when setting price ceilings and monitoring compliance. Through these amendments the Government of Canada is taking steps to ensure that Canadians will have access to and be able to afford medicines that are necessary for their health and well-being.\n",

They are home to culturally and economically important fisheries, attract tourism and recreation, and allow the import and export of goods through responsible shipping. Under the Oceans Protection Plan, Fisheries and Oceans Canada is working with Indigenous and coastal communities, in addition to regional stakeholders, to develop and implement a Coastal Environmental Baseline Program. The Coastal Environmental Baseline Program is a $50.8 million initiative focusing on the state of six marine ecosystems with high or increasing vessel traffic and coastline development, including: the Port of Vancouver, BC; the Port of Prince Rupert, BC; the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary, QC; the Port of Saint John, NB; Placentia Bay, NL; and Iqaluit, NU.

The $300-million Community Efficiency Financing initiative helps municipalities and their partners implement innovative local financing programs that directly help homeowners cut their greenhouse gas emissions and make their homes more comfortable and affordable while helping keep the local economy moving. The initiative encourages innovation through a bottom-up approach to local program design, offering applicants the opportunity to study and design programs tailored to local priorities and contexts. These programs for low-rise residential properties may build on approaches such as Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) and utility on-bill financing. Starting today, municipalities and partners in early stages of program development will be able to access grants for studies intended to support communities through the decision-making process of the program design phase. These grants will help municipalities evaluate approaches for implementing innovative financing programs within the local context.\n",

Canadians have continually supported Canada’s international humanitarian response to refugee crises around the world. This tradition of humanitarian support demonstrates to the world that we have a shared responsibility to help those who are displaced, persecuted and most in need of protection. We also recognize the particular, intersectional vulnerabilities experienced by women and girls, children, LGBTQ2 persons, and all others belonging to marginalized and targeted groups. This year we celebrate Canada’s 40th anniversary of Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program. We thank the more than two million Canadians who have helped sponsor more than 327,000 refugees and have made the program a model around the world. Canada is sharing this expertise by helping other countries set up refugee sponsorship programs. On World Refugee Day, we acknowledge the struggles faced by refugees and we highlight their courage and resilience. We also commend all the compassionate Canadians who helped out others in need. As a recognized leader in humanitarian assistance, Canada is working hard globally to change the way humanitarian assistance is designed and delivered so that women and girls are not left behind. Canada is an open and diverse country. For refugees fleeing danger, intolerance and chaos, these qualities are a source of hope, and provide a safe haven for the world’s most vulnerable people. This is the tradition we commemorate on World Refugee Day.”\n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is committed to a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples; one that is based on the recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership. As part of the Prime Minister's announcement in August 2017, the department of Indigenous Services Canada (DISC) was created as one of two new departments to bolster this renewed relationship, and ‎address the unacceptable socio-economic gaps that exist between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous Canadians. DISC is building on the work already done in Budget 2016 and 2017 and is responsible for improving the delivery and quality of day-to-day services for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation, while also supporting the path to self-determination of Indigenous peoples who rightfully want and need to control service delivery for their own people. Over the past two years, progress has been made in many areas; reducing the number of long-term drinking water advisories ‎on public systems on reserve, thousands of new housing units built, new investments for education programming and infrastructure, mental health and crisis supports for communities, and advancing a new fiscal relationship.  But, we know that there is much more work ahead, and we are committed to working in partnership with Indigenous peoples in doing so. ‎To help outline some of the next steps, the Honourable Jane Philpott, Minister of Indigenous Services and Jean-François Tremblay, Deputy Minister of Indigenous Services, today held a media briefing to outline the key priorities of the new department of Indigenous Services Canada. The presentation outlined some of the current challenges, points of progress since November 2015, and the path forward, in five key priority areas: • Improving Health outcomes• Quality Education• Child & Family Services• Reliable Infrastructure, including Housing & Water• A New Fiscal Relationship\n",

      "News Release Text: Canada’s hog sector, which includes over 8000 hog farms, is a key driver of the Canadian economy, accounting for $4.5 billion in farm receipts and $4 billion in pork exports in 2017.  Parliamentary Secretary Jean-Claude Poissant, on behalf of Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Lawrence MacAulay, today announced investments of over $1.5 million to support animal health and disease surveillance in the hog sector.  The Government will invest up to $1.5 million in the Canadian Pork Council (CPC) to adopt a virus detection system to support animal health. Funded under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership’s AgriAssurance Program, the virus detection system will enable the CPC to provide consistent information on the health status of the hog population across the country, track early disease warning signs, and rapidly identify new and emerging diseases in the sector before they spread.  This complements a previous investment of more than $94,000 to the University of Montréal (UdeM) to develop an advanced disease surveillance tool to enable faster threat detection across Canada. With funding under Growing Forward 2’s AgriMarketing Program (Assurance Systems stream), the surveillance model developed by the UdeM’s Diagnostic Services will enable the hog sector to better understand the frequency of diseases, emerging strains, and the movement of endemic diseases in Canada.\n",

      "Location: Ontario\n",
      "News Release Text: Today, the Department of Finance is launching consultations with stakeholders on the recent federal budget’s proposal to introduce a new investment tax credit for capital invested in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects. Canadian innovators and engineers have developed some of the leading global technologies for CCUS, which are in demand as more countries take action to fight climate change. Investing in these technologies today is a significant step towards achieving Canada’s climate targets—and a greener, more resilient future for all Canadians. CCUS is an important tool for reducing emissions in high-emitting sectors. It uses advanced technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion, industrial processes, or directly from the air. The captured carbon can then be used to create new and innovative products or stored deep underground. The federal government intends for the new investment tax credit to be available for a broad range of CCUS applications across different industrial subsectors (e.g. concrete, plastics, fuels), including blue hydrogen projects and direct air capture projects, but not enhanced oil recovery projects. The government is seeking input from all industrial subsectors, recognizing that various subsectors face different challenges in adopting CCUS. The consultation will include key provincial governments, as part of efforts to encourage complementary measures for CCUS projects in their respective jurisdictions. The CCUS investment tax credit will be available starting in 2022. On the same timeline, the government will also determine how comparable tax support could be provided to producers of green hydrogen. Stakeholders are invited to provide comments on the government’s proposed approach by September 7, 2021. Details regarding how to participate are found in the related link below.\n",

      "Location: Location not found\n",
      "News Release Text: The new amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations: Temporary foreign workers are entitled to be informed about their rights in Canada. Therefore, the employer must provide the foreign worker with up-to-date information about their rights in Canada. The employer must provide this information on or before the first day of work, and in the worker’s language of choice (either English or French, the two official languages of Canada). The employer must also make this information available to the temporary foreign worker throughout their period of employment. Information on the rights of temporary foreign workers can be found on Canada.ca: This amendment ensures that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada, and the temporary foreign worker all have the same information regarding the conditions of employment.   When an employer who is hiring under the TFWP submits their request for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), they must now commit to having an employment agreement with the temporary foreign worker. The employer must provide the temporary foreign worker with a signed copy of the employment agreement on or before the first day of work. A similar condition applies to employers who are hiring under the IMP. When they submit an offer of employment in the Employer Portal, they must attest that they have already provided the temporary foreign worker with an employment agreement. In both programs, the employment agreement must match the offer of employment. The employment agreement must provide for employment in the same occupation, with the same wages and with the same working conditions as those set out in the offer of employment. The employment agreement must be drafted in the temporary foreign worker’s choice of English or French, and it must be signed by both the employer and the temporary foreign worker. This amendment is expected to improve temporary foreign workers’ understanding of their wages and the work they will be performing. Employers were previously obligated to make reasonable efforts to provide temporary foreign workers with a workplace free of abuse. Under the new amendments, the definition of “abuse” has been updated to include a direct reference to “reprisal.”   This amendment addresses the principle that temporary foreign workers should not be paying for their recruitment. This should mitigate concerns about their financial exploitation. This amendment prohibits employers from charging or recovering the following fees: Employers must also ensure that any recruiters acting on their behalf do not charge or recover these fees. Workers will continue to pay the fees related to temporary visas, temporary resident permits and work permits. Any fees that are related to the recruitment of the foreign worker and that are authorized under an international agreement between Canada and a country participating in the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program are also excluded from this prohibition. These amendments apply to the period before employment starts, as well as during the employment period. First, when employers who are hiring under the TFWP submit their request for an LMIA, they must confirm that they have not charged or recovered fees from a foreign worker in relation to the LMIA or to recruitment, and that they will not do so. They must also confirm that any third-party recruiter acting on their behalf does not charge or recover such fees. Employers who are hiring under the IMP must attest when submitting an offer of employment in the Employer Portal that neither they nor any third party they have used have charged or recovered any fees related to employer compliance fees or recruitment fees.  Second, for both programs, a new condition prohibits employers, during the period of employment, from charging or recovering from temporary foreign workers fees paid by the employer for their recruitment. Employers must also ensure that any recruiter acting on their behalf does not directly or indirectly charge or recover these fees from the worker. If an employer (or a recruiter acting on their behalf) charges or recovers prohibited fees, either before or during the period of employment, they will be able to justify this if: All employers under both the TFWP and the IMP are now required to make reasonable efforts to provide access to health care services when a temporary foreign worker is injured or becomes ill at the workplace. For example, reasonable efforts could include: All TFWP employers must obtain and pay for private health insurance that covers emergency medical care during the period for which the temporary foreign worker is not covered by their provincial or territorial health insurance system. This condition applies to all TFWP employers, except in the case of employers who employ a foreign worker under an agreement reached between Canada and another country concerning seasonal agricultural workers, where the agreement includes health insurance. To help support employer inspections, Employment and Social Development Canada and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada now have the authority to require, without the consent of the employer or worker, that any third party provide any document in their possession that relates to the employer’s compliance with regulatory conditions. Examples of third parties include banks and payroll companies. Employment and Social Development Canada and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada will continue to adhere to the Privacy Act and to the privacy requirements of their respective legislation. They will collect only the information that is necessary for the intended authorized purpose. In this case, the intended authorized purpose is to support the inspection process and verify employer compliance, particularly in instances where the employer is uncooperative. Employment and Social Development Canada now has the authority to suspend the processing of an LMIA request if there is reason to suspect that the employer is non-compliant with one or more of the following conditions, and that the health or safety of the foreign worker would be put at risk if a work permit were issued:  The suspension would remain in effect until there is no longer a reason to suspect a serious risk to the health or safety of the worker. In this case, the suspension would be lifted and the processing of the new LMIA would continue. If there were still a reason to suspect non-compliance with program conditions, the inspection process would continue. This amendment increases Employment and Social Development Canada’s capacity to identify potential wrongdoing when assessing an employer’s request for an LMIA. This applies to employers who have not employed a foreign worker under the TFWP in the past six years. Employment and Social Development Canada is now required to assess, during the period extending from two years before the day on which a request for an LMIA is received and up to the day that the LMIA is provided, whether the employer:   Under the previous regulations, Employment and Social Development Canada assessed seven different factors to determine whether the employment of the foreign worker would be likely to have a neutral or positive effect on the labour market in Canada. These seven factors were given equal consideration as part of an overall assessment. Failure to meet one or more of these seven factors would not have resulted in an automatic refusal. Now, upon receipt of an LMIA request, Employment and Social Development Canada will consider two of these factors independently: These two factors will be assessed on a pass or fail basis, while the remaining factors will continue to be taken as part of the overall assessment.   Regardless of the assessment of the other five factors, these two factors are requirements. They must be satisfied in order for an employer to receive a positive LMIA. This amendment confirms Employment and Social Development Canada’s authority to collect personal information on employers and temporary foreign workers in order to verify an employer’s compliance with the conditions of the IMP. This could include information received through the TFWP Confidential Tip Line or the online reporting tool. It also includes information that is reported in the media. Any relevant information would be shared with inspection officials from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.  Some provinces have requirements for employers to register with the province before recruiting and hiring temporary foreign workers. In addition, some jurisdictions also require mandatory licensing of recruiters. This new amendment clarifies that employers must comply with all provincial and territorial employment and recruitment laws, including those laws that specifically relate to temporary foreign workers, in the province or territory where the temporary foreign worker will work.  Employment and Social Development Canada and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada have not used employer compliance review authorities since 2019. This is because the inspection authorities are more effective for detecting employer non-compliance. This amendment officially repeals the employer compliance review provisions and brings the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations in line with current practices.\n",

      "News Release Text: On December 2, 2021, as a result of the vigilance of staff members, contraband items were seized at Springhill Institution, a federal medium security institution. The contraband items seized included two stabbing weapons, three knives, 18 Effexor pills and 28 grams of cocaine. The total estimated institutional value of this seizure is $28,000.                                                      The police have been notified and the institution is investigating. The Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) uses a number of tools to prevent drugs from entering its institutions. These tools include ion scanners and drug-detector dogs to search buildings, personal property, inmates, and visitors. CSC is heightening measures to prevent contraband from entering its institutions in order to help ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone. CSC also works in partnership with the police to take action against those who attempt to introduce contraband into correctional institutions. CSC has set up a telephone tip line for all federal institutions so that it may receive additional information about activities relating to security at CSC institutions. These activities may be related to drug use or trafficking that may threaten the safety and security of visitors, inmates, and staff members working at CSC institutions. The toll-free number, 1‑866‑780‑3784, helps ensure that the information shared is protected and that callers remain anonymous. -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: Gatineau, Quebec, August 27, 2020 – Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) Quebec’s future and economic recovery depend on the strength of its businesses and organizations. For many years now, the Government of Canada has been committed to supporting these businesses and organizations for the ultimate benefit of Quebecers. The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, visited the Outaouais region today to announce a total of $1,553,448 in financial assistance. This funding will help expand the entrepreneurial ecosystem and allow recipients to continue operating despite the impact of the health crisis. The Outaouais region is home to hundreds of dynamic entrepreneurs and organizations with innovative ideas, which help stimulate their communities by creating high‑quality jobs and boosting the local economy. With this in mind, CED is providing $1,263,448 in support to five projects related to business start‑up and growth and international marketing. Additional information on the projects is provided in the related backgrounder. The health crisis has had a major impact on the Outaouais economy, and a number of the region’s organizations need help to structure their operations, manage their cash flow and adapt to COVID‑19 in order to continue operating. CED is therefore providing $290,000 to ID Gatineau so that from now until March 31, 2021, it can offer technical assistance to businesses and NPOs affected by the economic fallout of COVID‑19 located in the Gatineau, Hull and Aylmer areas. These businesses and organizations will be able to draw on the expertise and support of specialized resources to better prepare for the economic recovery.\n",

      "News Release Text: July 28, 2021 – Vancouver, British Columbia Canada has an impressive history in biomanufacturing and life sciences., from the discovery of insulin one hundred years ago, to the Canadian scientists who were instrumental in developing the polio and Ebola vaccines, to the Canadian veterinarian who discovered the first blood thinner. However, a 40-year decline in the sector left Canada without the large-scale and flexible biomanufacturing capacity necessary to quickly produce a COVID-19 vaccine when the pandemic hit. This is why the Government of Canada has worked tirelessly to rebuild Canada’s domestic biomanufacturing sector by focusing on both short-term strategic solutions and a long‑term vision. The Government of Canada has already invested over $1.2 billion to rebuild Canada’s vaccine, therapeutics and biomanufacturing capacity right here at home. As Canadians begin to look towards a post-pandemic future, the Government of Canada continues to build resiliency in Canada’s biomanufacturing and life sciences sector as part of the government’s recovery plan. Through strategic investments informed by experts, we are strengthening Canada’s biomanufacturing and life sciences sector, improving economic growth and ensuring pandemic readiness for years to come. Today, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, and the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, launched the Biomanufacturing and Life Sciences Strategy. This means more than $2.2 billion over seven years from Budget 2021 to continue growing a strong and competitive sector and to ensure our country is prepared for future pandemics. The Biomanufacturing and Life Sciences Strategy is driven by two objectives: to grow a strong, competitive domestic life sciences sector, with cutting-edge biomanufacturing capabilities, while creating good jobs for Canadians, and to make sure Canada is prepared for pandemics and other health emergencies in the future. This includes increasing domestic capacity through investments and partnerships to produce life-saving vaccines and therapeutics. The strategy consists of five pillars: Together, the strategy’s five pillars will achieve meaningful results for Canadians by building strength across the sector’s entire value chain, from research and talent to clinical trials, to industrial capabilities and, finally, to the regulatory environment supporting all of these areas. The strategy will improve Canada’s pandemic preparedness for years to come, while creating good quality jobs for Canadians across the country. It will also establish an enduring, coordinated framework for working in alignment across federal departments and agencies responsible for the discovery, development, production and deployment of critical medicines for Canadians, while continuing to rely on the advice of experts.\n",

      "News Release Text: On October 25, 2012, conditional permanent residence was introduced for sponsored spouses and partners of Canadian citizens and permanent residents who were in a relationship of two years or less and had no children in common, at the time of their sponsorship application. Since that time, more than 100 000 individuals have come to Canada as conditional permanent residents. The condition was introduced as a means to deter people from seeking to immigrate to Canada through non-genuine relationships. It required the sponsored spouse or partner to live in a conjugal relationship with their sponsor for two years unless they were the victim of abuse or the sponsor died. As a result, an imbalance was created between the sponsor and the sponsored individual, as only the sponsored spouse or partner could lose their status if the two-year cohabitation condition was not met. Stakeholders expressed concerns that this placed abused spouses and partners in a vulnerable position. Even though there was an exception to the condition for people in such situations, it is possible a victim may not have been aware of it or may have chosen to stay in the abusive relationship for a number of reasons. Those could include the fear of coming forward, the perceived challenge of proving the abuse or neglect, fear of needing to continue to live with their alleged abuser, or fear of having their status revoked and being removed from Canada if the exception was not granted. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada assessed the impact of conditional permanent residence. It was determined that, on balance, using conditional permanent residence as a tool to deter marriage fraud had not proved to outweigh the potential risks to vulnerable sponsored spouses and partners. Now that conditional permanent residence has been eliminated, anyone who was sponsored by someone who was subject to the condition and therefore also received conditional permanent residence him or herself, such as a child or a parent, has also had the condition lifted. The Government takes marriage fraud seriously and continues to have measures in place to safeguard against it. Immigration officers are trained to assess all applications and must be satisfied that a relationship is legitimate before granting the sponsored spouse or partner their permanent residence. In instances where marriage fraud may surface, these cases are investigated and the sponsored individual may lose their permanent resident status and be removed from Canada on the basis of misrepresentation. There is also a five-year bar on sponsorship to deter people from using a marriage of convenience to come to Canada. Sponsored spouses or partners must wait five years from the day they are granted permanent residence in Canada before they themselves are eligible to sponsor a new spouse or partner. In addition, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada works closely with Public Safety Canada and its portfolio agencies on risk indicators and anti-fraud initiatives. With the elimination of conditional permanent residence, any case that was under investigation for non-compliance with the cohabitation condition has ceased. However, cases involving marriage fraud will continue to be investigated.\n",

Employers play a fundamental role in Canada’s apprenticeship systems; however, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not always have the resources to offer apprenticeship training opportunities.  Organizations funded under the Apprenticeship Service will distribute financial incentives to SMEs that hire apprentices. They will also provide additional supports, such as help navigating the apprenticeship system, onboarding apprentices, and creating welcoming workplaces. SMEs with 499 or fewer paid employees are eligible for the funding. Under the Apprenticeship Service, SMEs will receive $5,000 for each new, first-year apprentice hired, for a maximum of two eligible apprentices per year. They can use the incentive to pay for upfront costs such as salaries and training. In addition, to boost diversity in the Red Seal trades, this incentive will be doubled to $10,000 for employers who hire from equity-deserving groups, specifically women, persons with disabilities, Indigenous people, members of the LGBTQ2+ communities, newcomers and visible minorities, including Black and other racialized communities.  Apprenticeship START Plus Project The Government of Canada is providing over $28 million for the Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency’s Apprenticeship START Plus project. The project will provide financial support to SMEs in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. Through this project, up to 4,900 agreements with SMEs will be signed from the above-mentioned provinces. Through these agreements, a minimum of 5,200 first-year apprentices in eligible Red Seal trades, including a minimum of 1,190 from equity-deserving groups, are expected to be hired.

      "News Release Text: Ottawa, Ontario, June 5, 2017 – The Government of Canada and Irving Shipbuilding Inc. are extending the submission deadline for the Canadian Surface Combatant Request for Proposals (RFP).  To maximize value for Canadians we continue to work into close partnership with industry and we are responding to all questions from bidders resulting in this extension. Previously scheduled for June 22, 2017, the deadline for bid submissions is expected to be no sooner than mid-August 2017. As per the RFP, bidders can submit draft bids for review until June 15, 2017. These bids will not be scored, and financial information will not be submitted, but bidders will be informed if any part of their submission is non-compliant, so they can make adjustments before submitting a final bid. Following the compliance review deadline of June 15, 2017, the Government of Canada will review the draft bids. The time required for this review will depend on the number and quality of draft bids received. Feedback will be given to the bidders, who will then have 4 weeks in which to revise their bids. We will continue to be open and transparent throughout this process. This is the second extension granted through this RFP process. The original deadline was set for April 27, 2017. On February 16, 2017, the deadline was extended to June 22, 2017. All questions from bidders have been answered, and pre-qualified bidders are working with this amended RFP. It is not unusual for bidding periods to be extended, particularly for complex initiatives such as this one, which is the most complex procurement project undertaken by the Government of Canada in recent history. With this extension, targeted completion for the procurement process moves to 2018 from fall 2017. The start of ship construction remains scheduled for the early 2020s. The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring an open, fair and transparent procurement process, and to providing the Royal Canadian Navy with the vessels it needs to do its important work and at the best possible value for Canadians. - 30 - Annie Trépanier\n",

      "News Release Text: Today, the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) for Canada, Dr. Jaspinder Komal, issued the following statement about the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's continuing efforts in support of African swine fever (ASF) preparedness: \"On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is working closely with provincial partners, industry stakeholders, farms and animal welfare groups to prevent and mitigate the impact of ASF. On June 18, CFIA's Quebec and Western areas hosted ASF preparation exercises involving provincial partners and other stakeholders. These exercises are key to coordinating activities in the event that ASF is reported in Canada. I want to stress that ASF has never been in Canada and it is through activities such as the June 18 exercises that we are making concerted efforts to keep it that way. We also recognize that our country must be fully prepared for all scenarios, so a key element of our work together focuses on preparedness. CFIA's Quebec Area, the Ministère de l'Agriculture, des Pêcheries et de l'Alimentation du Québec (MAPAQ) and the Équipe québécoise de santé porcine (ÉQSP) took part in the exercise, which involved a simulated scenario in which ASF was suspected on a hog farm in Quebec. Participants were located in Gaspé, Montreal, Quebec City, St-Hyacinthe and Moncton, NB, and communicated through videoconference and phone. The scenario allowed participants to: The exercise met all of the planned objectives, including validating the strategies to be used to coordinate actions of the different parties if ASF is suspected in Quebec. The day's activities were timely, relevant and beneficial to improve preparedness against ASF and other animal diseases. They confirmed the value of carrying on with preparedness activities, exploring additional training and updating response plans. More than 30 government and industry representatives met in Winnipeg, MB, to discuss potential issues and challenges if ASF is reported in Western Canada. Pork producers, processors and organizations such as the Animal Welfare Council of Canada and PigTrace joined with CFIA, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and provincial CVOs in the day-long meeting. Discussions focused on: The exercise resulted in important steps forward. Participants committed to creating a formal ICS and to forming a steering committee consisting of federal, provincial and industry partners. The committee will identify planning gaps and work out a joint Emergency Operations Centre structure.\" Dr. Jaspinder KomalChief Veterinary Officer for CanadaCanadian Food Inspection Agency For media inquiriesCanadian Food Inspection AgencyMedia relations: 613-773-6600cfia.media.acia@canada.ca\n",

You can also access long-term health support services such as mental health counselling, community-based emotional support, cultural services, and some travel costs to see Elders and traditional healers. August 11, 2022 — Fisher River Cree Nation, Manitoba — Crown−Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada Today, leaders from the Fisher River Cree Nation and the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Crown−Indigenous Relations, launched the Red Turtle Lodge Cultural Centre project. The Government of Canada is providing $1.24 million towards construction of the centre through the Cultural Spaces in Indigenous Communities Program. The Red Turtle Lodge Cultural Centre will be a hub where members of the Fisher River Cree Nation will gather, learn and share traditional practices with a special focus on the needs of women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. The Red Turtle Lodge Cultural Centre will partner with the First Nation Healing Centre to support women and children who have experienced domestic abuse and family violence. Healing circles, full-moon ceremonies, and an annual women’s healing gathering are among the planned initiatives. Programming at the Red Turtle Lodge Cultural Centre will also include land-based wellness workshops to support community members who are living with intergenerational trauma as they restore and strengthen their connections to the Cree way of life, traditions and language. Budget 2021 announced $108.8 million over two years for the Cultural Spaces in Indigenous Communities Program. This investment is part of the Federal Pathway to Address Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People, the Government of Canada’s contribution to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Girls, Women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan, and supports the response to Call for Justice 2.3. This transformative program supports Indigenous Peoples in reclaiming their identity and working towards healing. Investing in cultural spaces is crucial to addressing the root causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ individuals. Indigenous groups have also highlighted culturally centred spaces as essential to self-determination.\n",

      "When every Canadian has the opportunity for meaningful work, our middle class is stronger and our economy thrives. That’s why, through Budget 2018, the Government of Canada is taking the next step to ensure that all Canadians have a fair shot at success. Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, was in Winnipeg to highlight Budget 2018 investments and talk about the new Canada Workers Benefit (CWB). The CWB will put more money in the pockets of low-income workers. Building on the former Working Income Tax Benefit (WITB), the CWB will encourage more people to join the workforce, and offer real help to more than two million Canadians who are working hard to join the middle class, while raising around 70,000 Canadians out of poverty. With almost $1 billion in new funding starting in 2019, the proposed CWB will increase both maximum benefits and the income level at which the benefit is entirely phased out. As a result, a low-income worker earning $15,000 could receive up to almost $500 more from the CWB in 2019. Unlike the old WITB, everyone who can benefit from the new CWB will receive it even if they do not claim it when they file their taxes. By continuing to invest in the middle class and those working hard to join it, the Government of Canada is ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to fully contribute to the Canadian economy, leading to economic growth that everyone.\n",

      "News Release Text: The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship today issued the following statement: “Canada confirms that India formally communicated its plan to remove immunities unilaterally for all but 21 Canadian diplomats and dependents in New Delhi by October 20, 2023. This means 41 Canadian diplomats and their 42 dependents were in danger of having immunities stripped. “Given the security implications of India’s actions on these Canadian diplomats and their families, Canada has facilitated their safe departure from India. “A unilateral revocation of diplomatic privileges and immunities is contrary to international law, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. This action taken by India is completely unreasonable and escalatory. India accredited each and every one of the Canadian diplomats they are now expelling. And all of those diplomats were carrying out their duties in good faith, and to the greater benefit of both countries. “Diplomatic immunities should be respected and cannot be unilaterally revoked by a host country. If we allow this norm to be broken, no diplomat anywhere would be safe. As such, the Government of Canada will continue to respect diplomatic norms and not reciprocate this action. “Canada will continue to defend international law, which applies equally to all states. Canada will continue to engage India and remains committed to dialogue as we move forward. “Unfortunately, this mass expulsion will impact our operations, and client service will be affected. We will now be forced to pause temporarily all in-person services at Consulates, until further notice. India’s decision will impact levels of services to citizens of both countries. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will continue to accept and process applications from India. However, certain application requirements will need to be completed locally or on-site in a secure environment. As a result, the reduction in the size of the IRCC team will affect service standards for residents of India. “Five IRCC staff remain in India and will focus on work that requires an in­-country presence such as urgent processing, visa printing, risk assessment and overseeing key partners, including visa application centres, panel physicians and clinics that perform immigration medical exams. The rest of the work and staff will be reassigned across our global processing network. “India’s decision will not distract from Canada’s legitimate investigation into the killing of Mr. Nijjar. Canada’s priorities in this matter continue to be the pursuit of the truth, the protection of Canadians, and the defence of our sovereignty.” Canadians in need of consular assistance in India can still contact the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi at +91 11 4178 2000, or via email at: india.consular@international.gc.ca  Canadians may also contact Global Affairs Canada's Emergency Watch and Response Centre:\n",

      "News Release Text: When Soviet troops marched on Budapest in 1956 to crush a revolution that sought political reform and independence from the Soviet Union, thousands of Hungarians fled to safety in neighbouring nations. Many of these people would then emigrate elsewhere to settle permanently. With the support of its population, in 1956 and 1957 Canada received more than 37,500 of these Hungarian refugees. Spurred on by popular sympathy for the refugees, the federal government worked in cooperation with non-profit organizations to quickly select, transport, and resettle people, a process which established an important model for the reception of future refugees to Canada. Hungarian refugees settled across the country, with many choosing to live in Toronto, Vancouver, Montréal, and other urban centres, where they made significant contributions to economic and cultural life. The influx of Hungarian refugees into Canada contributed significantly to Canadian society, particularly to its cultural diversity. It fueled a cultural movement that saw an increase in social clubs, artistic performance, new publications, and sporting events based in the Hungarian community. During this time, Hungarian Canadians emerged with a renewed pride in their ancestry. Furthermore, the thousands of Hungarian refugees, many of whom were young and educated, contributed to the expansion of Canada’s economy by contributing their skills to the Canadian workforce. In addition, this large immigration wave from an Eastern Bloc country led the way for other movements from Communist countries. Moved by the Hungarian refugee situation, the public quickly rallied to their cause, prompting the government to do everything it could to help with their resettlement. Their arrival also helped Canadians adopt a more positive attitude toward immigration and transformed Canadian immigration policies. \n",

      "News Release Text: Confronting climate change in thoughtful ways offers the potential for significant economic opportunities for businesses, communities and workers in Canada. That is why the Government of Canada is committed to building a clean energy future: to protect the environment, strengthen the economy and create good jobs. Today, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Natural Resources, announced an investment of more than $1.9 million to accelerate the development of innovative technologies that will reduce fossil fuel consumption at Lafarge Canada Inc.'s cement plants in Richmond, British Columbia, and Brookfield, Nova Scotia. Lafarge Canada Inc. also provided funding toward the $18.5-million project. The investment supported Lafarge in launching a new and improved lower carbon fuel system to reduce pollution associated with the production of cement. The project, which is now complete, aimed to make the two facilities among the most carbon-efficient cement plants in Canada by lowering fossil fuel use with non-recyclable waste byproducts and minimizing landfill waste. Federal funding was provided through Natural Resources Canada’s Energy Innovation Program, which supports clean energy innovation, ensures clean energy technologies are widely affordable and helps drive economic growth, leading to a low-carbon economy with good, clean jobs. The Government of Canada will continue to support innovative projects and technologies that support a healthy environment and healthy economy, on our way to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",

Canada is home to a well-educated and highly skilled workforce, but as the demands of the workplace change, so too must the education and skills that workers bring to their jobs. The changes in the economy—both here at home and around the world—present incredible opportunities for the middle class and those working hard to join it. Today, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance Ginette Petitpas Taylor, alongside Anthony Rota, Member of Parliament for Nipissing – Timiskaming, were in North Bay to highlight Budget 2017, Building a Strong Middle Class, the Government's ambitious agenda to support middle class Canadians at every stage of their lives, transform our neighbourhoods and communities, and give every Canadian a real and fair chance at success. Speaking at a roundtable at the Discovery North Bay Museum with mayors, community leaders, stakeholders and leaders from the Indigenous community, Parliamentary Secretary Petitpas Taylor and Mr. Rota discussed how Budget 2017 keeps Canada on the path to building a fairer, more inclusive country that reflects the priorities of Canadians. The Government understands that change must result in the kind of growth that benefits all Canadians, at every stage of their lives—young Canadians, newcomers to Canada, working Canadians, seniors, veterans and Indigenous Peoples.\n",

Today, we honour the memory of those who lost their lives and those others who suffered so greatly. “Canada remains deeply concerned by the dire human rights situation on the Crimean peninsula, which is under continued and illegal Russian occupation, as well as by the mistreatment of the Crimean Tatar people and the destruction of their historic sites. We continue to denounce Russia’s banning of the Mejlis, the self-governing body of the Crimean Tatars, and call for Russia to reverse this illegal and immoral decision. “In March 2019, Canada imposed new sanctions on Russia in response to its breaching of international rules, including its ongoing occupation of Crimea. We condemn Russia’s decision to extend citizenship to Ukrainian citizens, a decision that carries serious implications and forms part of Russia’s playbook, aimed at destabilizing the region. “In my visit to Ukraine last week, I reaffirmed Canada’s continued and unwavering friendship with the people of Ukraine and our commitment to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We are also committed to working closely with the Crimean Tatar community to denounce the injustices they face and find concrete ways to protect their human rights. Until Russia respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and international law, the international community and Canada will continue to maintain pressure, including through economic sanctions.”\n",

      "News Release Text: The Government of Canada is working with all partners to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the variants of concern in Canada. Self-isolation is one of the most effective ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19. However, for some people in Canada, crowded housing conditions and high costs can make it unsafe or impossible to self-isolate, putting themselves, their families and communities at risk through no fault of their own. Today, Andy Fillmore, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, on behalf of the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, announced $4.2 million to operate safe voluntary isolation sites in Nova Scotia. These sites help those who have COVID-19, or have been exposed to it, access safe isolation accommodations to keep themselves and their community safe. Voluntary isolation sites reduce the risks of spreading the virus among household contacts in situations where individuals are faced with crowded housing and do not have an alternative. These sites are one of the rapid response tools established to help stop the spread of COVID-19, and can be deployed to communities facing outbreaks. The Safe Voluntary Isolation Sites Program directly supports cities, municipalities and health regions that are at-risk of COVID-19 community transmission. Sites selected under the Program provide an accessible location where individuals can safely self-isolate for the required period. Local public health officials determine eligible individuals who may be offered the option to transfer to the isolation site on a voluntary basis to keep them and their household contacts safe during an outbreak in their community.\n",

      "News Release Text: People in the British Columbia (BC) Interior and communities across Canada deserve to feel safe in their communities. That’s why the Government of Canada is taking action with a comprehensive plan that gets guns off our streets and puts more resources into our communities. An important element of this work is stopping violence before it starts, which is why the government launched the $250 million Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF). First announced in March 2022, the BSCF supports local initiatives that prevent gun and gang violence and help young people make good choices. Today Pam Damoff, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety, on behalf of the Honourable Marco Mendicino, Minister of Public Safety, announced that the BC Interior will receive up to $6.9 million from the BSCF to prevent gun crime and gang violence in the region. This funding will help address the underlying conditions that give rise to crime. The municipality will distribute it to community-led projects for young people involved in gangs or at risk of joining them – helping them set themselves up for success in life. No single program or initiative can tackle the challenge of gun crime on its own. The BSCF is one of many elements in the Government’s plan to keep Canadians safe. Our work begins at Canada’s borders, where we’ve added resources to fight smuggling and stop guns from coming into the country. The Government banned assault-style firearms like the AR-15 two years ago and will soon begin a buyback program to get these guns out of our communities. Last October, a national freeze on handguns was implemented. Finally, we recently introduced Bill C-21 – Canada’s most significant action on gun violence in a generation. In addition to the handgun freeze, it proposes significant provisions to combat organized crime and address the alarming role of guns in domestic violence.           \n",

      "News Release Text: Trois-Rivières, Quebec, June 30, 2021 – Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) The Mauricie region counts several dynamic businesses and organizations that help to create a strong local economic fabric. Some organizations have succeeded in adapting to the pandemic and are prospering, while others have had to reduce their operations. Today, as we plan for the economic recovery, they need our support now more than ever to ensure their communities remain robust. The Government of Canada has committed to assisting them as they pursue their activities and to fostering their growth and success. With this in mind, the Honourable Pablo Rodriguez, Quebec Lieutenant and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, and the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Member of Parliament for Saint-Maurice–Champlain and Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, today announced $375,000 in financial support to Germain et Frère on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for CED. Germain et Frère has been specializing in the design, manufacturing and installation of building ventilation systems and industrial procedures for heavy industry for more than 100 years. This repayable contribution will allow it to acquire production equipment, in particular a laser cutting table, a digital press brake and an overhead crane system. The Government of Canada recognizes and supports innovative businesses and organizations that are a source of pride in their communities. Quebec’s economic recovery relies, among other things, on organizations that are well grounded in the regional economy. Innovation is a major contributor to growth, as well as a key asset in rebuilding a stronger, more resilient, and more just economy for all. “From the start of the pandemic, we have been there for the people of Trois-Rivières and to protect their jobs. By investing in Germain et Frère’s talent today, we are confirming that we will continue to be there to help local families recover from the pandemic and to create good jobs as part of the economic recovery.” The Honourable Pablo Rodriguez, Member of Parliament for Honoré-Mercier and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons “Community prosperity is a priority for the Government of Canada. That is why CED is supporting small and medium-sized businesses in their efforts to enhance their productivity, develop new products or improve their existing products and services. Germain et Frère is a major contributor to Trois-Rivières’ economic vitality, and the success of its project will reverberate throughout the entire region.” The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Member of Parliament for Saint-Maurice–Champlain and Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry “Helping businesses grow and innovate so they can enhance their competitiveness and create good‑quality jobs is at the core of our priorities. That is why we are providing our support to Germain et Frère, a business whose success is raising the profile not just of the Mauricie region but of the entire Canadian economy as well.

      "News Release Text: Women and Gender Equality Canada’s Women’s Program One of the ways Women and Gender Equality Canada advances gender equality in Canada is by providing funding to eligible organizations through the Women’s Program. Projects are selected via calls for proposals on specific themes, as well as through a continuous intake process that allows the Women’s Program to address emerging issues as they arise.                                                   The Women’s Program funds projects that address systemic barriers to women’s equality in three priority areas: ending violence against women and girls; improving the economic security and prosperity of women and girls; and encouraging women and girls in leadership roles. Capacity-building Call for Proposals In October 2018, Minister Monsef announced a Call for Proposals under the Capacity-building Fund of the Women’s Program. Projects at the local, provincial, and national level were eligible for different amounts of funding, based on their specific need and reach. On March 8, 2019, International Women’s Day, Minister Monsef announced that over 250 women’s organizations across the country would receive funding from the Capacity-building Fund. The objective is to fund proposals that will increase the capacity of eligible women’s organizations and Indigenous organizations serving women, whose initiatives contribute to a viable women’s movement in Canada that advances gender equality. Funding will increase the ability of organizations to grow, meet the increasing demands for their services, and continue to work collectively to address gender equality issues. The fund stems from the Budget 2018 announcement of $100 million over five years to help support a viable and sustainable women’s movement across Canada. Mississauga Project Today’s announcement profiled a project in Mississauga selected for federal funding through the Capacity-building Fund:Canadian Association for Girls in Science (CAGIS) Project title: Improving Efficiency, Growth Capacity, and Sustainability of the Canadian Association for Girls in ScienceFunding amount: $548,804 CAGIS does not have the capacity to meet the demand for their services. This funding will help make its services available to more young women to promote, educate, and develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among girls aged seven to sixteen.  Inspired by the dream of Larissa Vingilis-Jaremko when she was just nine years old, CAGIS is a network of girls who like STEM and want to learn more. \n",

      "News Release Text: April 1, 2021 – Ottawa, Ontario The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how much we rely on our connections. Now more than ever, Canadians across the country need access to reliable high-speed Internet as many of us are working, learning, and staying in touch with friends and family from home. Right now, too many Canadians living in rural and remote communities lack access to high-speed Internet. Through the Universal Broadband Fund’s (UBF) Rapid Response Stream, the Government of Canada is taking immediate action to get Canadians connected to the high-speed Internet they need. Today, Adam van Koeverden, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth and to the Minister of Canadian Heritage (Sport) and Member of Parliament for Milton, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development, announced $441,200 in funding for Bell Canada to bring high-speed Internet to rural Ontario residents. Bell will contribute $1,286,200 toward this project that will connect 756 underserved households to high-speed Internet in the following communities and surrounding rural areas: Ashgrove, Campbellville, Carlisle, Cedar Springs, Freelton, Hornby, Morriston, Waterdown and other areas just outside Milton. The project being announced today was approved within five months of the formal launch of the $1.75-billion Universal Broadband Fund. Projects funded under the UBF, as well as through other public and private investments, will help connect 98% of Canadians to high-speed Internet by 2026 and achieve the national target of 100% connectivity by 2030. Today’s announcement builds on the progress the Government of Canada has already made to improve critical infrastructure in Ontario. Since 2015, the federal government has invested more than $2.85 billion in over 4,060 infrastructure projects in Ontario communities with populations under 100,000 people. These investments mean 481 km of new or upgraded roads that are making our communities safer; more than 938 projects to provide residents with cleaner, more sustainable sources of drinking water; and more than 5,427 additional housing units built in rural communities, helping ensure all Ontarians have a safe place to call home.\n",

      "News Release Text: With health systems straining to respond adequately to the global pandemic, it is more important than ever to protect gains in comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to safe abortion and contraception, by ensuring crucial services are not diverted. Canada remains committed to delivering on its Feminist International Assistance Policy and development commitments in the context of COVID-19. The Honourable Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, today announced $93.7 million in funding toward ensuring that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe and every girl and woman is treated with the dignity and respect she deserves. A portion of this funding is part of the commitment announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in June 2019. Canada’s support will focus on areas often neglected in development assistance: comprehensive sexuality education and support for adolescents; advocacy; and family planning and contraceptives. It will also help prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and female genital mutilation and cutting, and will support both the right to choose safe and legal abortion and access to post-abortion care. Funding will help the most vulnerable by breaking down barriers faced by marginalised women. The Minister made this announcement at the #SheDecidesNow Virtual Round Table, which she co-hosted alongside Sonali Silva, SheDecides champion and 25 x 25 young leader. Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy continues to put women and girls at the centre of its development efforts—including by ensuring that health systems meet the needs of women and girls—particularly through support for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights. Today’s funding investments will help key partners support the most vulnerable people by working to ensure that crucial services continue to be provided and that progress continues in sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n",

Strategic investments in creating safe park spaces and a reliable water supply will play a key role in ensuring Newfoundland residents have modern facilities to support a healthy community. Today, Gudie Hutchings, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development and Member of Parliament for Long Range Mountains, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Scott Reid, Member of the House of Assembly for St. George’s‒Humber, and local officials announced funding for nine projects that create healthier communities in the Bay St. George Region. To improve access to modern recreation infrastructure, Flat Bay will see the completion of the Calm Water Mi’kmaq Park pond area. Bay St. George South will improve the skating rink in Robinsons and the MacKay’s community playground. Meanwhile, Pasadena will build a splash pad near Pasadena Place. These projects will help support healthy communities. To ensure access to safe and reliable drinking water, St. George’s and Flat Bay East water systems will be upgraded with the drilling of a new well that will connect to the existing water system. In Massey Drive, 21 homes on Lady Diana Crescent will have access to a potable water and a sanitary system with the installation of 210 metres of sewer and water lines. Pasadena will also improve its water infrastructure by installing a waterline to connect properties on Tipping Drive to the water system. The town will also build a new dam at Blue Gulch Pond to improve the drinking water quality for residents. The Government of Canada is investing more than $1.5 million in these projects through the Community, Culture and Recreation Infrastructure (CCRIS) and the Green Infrastructure Streams (GIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is providing over $1.2 million, while the municipalities and communities are contributing over $1 million. This is one in a series of important project announcements that will be made across the province over the coming weeks. We are working cooperatively to support jobs, improve our communities and build confidence as we safely and sustainably restore economic growth.\n",

      "News Release Text: Opioid-related overdoses have claimed the lives of thousands of Canadians and this crisis has been devastating for people who use drugs, their families, and communities throughout the country. Over the last year, the provinces, territories, and federal government have worked collaboratively to collect, analyze and share data on opioid-related mortality. Today, on behalf of the federal, provincial and territorial Special Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses, the Public Health Agency of Canada is releasing data that includes an update to the preliminary national data on apparent opioid-related deaths in 2016, the first half of 2017 and new data up to the third quarter of 2017 (July – September 2017). Unfortunately, the data released today have confirmed our fear that that the crisis has worsened significantly since 2016, despite the efforts from all levels of government and partners to reverse the trend. Available data from the provinces and territories indicate that at least 2,923 people died from apparent opioid-related overdoses between January and September 2017. This is an increase of 45% when compared to the same period in 2016. From January to September 2017, we lost as many people to the opioids crisis as we did for the entire course of 2016. Based on the latest data available, we expect that Canada will see more than 4,000 opioid-related deaths in 2017. The data also indicate that illegally produced fentanyl and other synthetic opioids remain a growing driver of this crisis. From January to September 2017, 72% of accidental apparent opioid-related deaths involved fentanyl or fentanyl analogues, compared to 55% in 2016. Overall, we also found that most accidental apparent opioid-related deaths occurred among males (76%), with the highest percentage among individuals between the ages of 30 and 39 (28%). For the first time, today’s release also includes data that break down unintentional (accidental) deaths and suicides. This type of breakdown is critical to our understanding of the crisis and helps all levels of government improve the way we deliver our prevention, treatment and response policies and programs. Based on the available data, 92% of apparent opioid-related deaths from January to September 2017 were unintentional, compared to 88% in 2016. We recognize that each death reported in today’s release represents a human life, and we are saddened by these losses. We recognize that all levels of government must do more to increase awareness, implement and evaluate innovative harm reduction approaches and increase access to effective treatment programs in order to turn the tide on this epidemic of opioid-related deaths. The provinces, territories and federal government are committed to working together through the Special Advisory Committee on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses to advance efforts to reduce opioid-related deaths and harms.

      "News Release Text: February 12, 2021 – Sudbury, ON – Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario – FedNor A skilled labour force is key to the growth of Canadian businesses and a strong economy. Well trained staff enable companies to increase productivity and efficiency, adapt quickly to challenges as they arise, respond to growth opportunities and improve profitability. The Government of Canada recognizes the challenges facing communities and businesses, particularly outside of larger urban centres, in accessing a skilled workforce to support development and growth efforts. Paul Lefebvre, Member of Parliament for Sudbury, and Marc G. Serré, Member of Parliament for Nickel Belt, today announced a Government of Canada investment of $95,000 to help the Northern Policy Institute to attract newcomers to the region and connect them with workplaces in need of their skills. The announcement was made on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for FedNor. This strategic project is engaging multiple stakeholders, communities and businesses across Northeastern Ontario to implement a plan to address challenges such as labour shortages, outmigration and an aging population that affect economic development in the region. Specifically, the funding is enabling the Northern Policy Institute to engage the services of two community matchmakers, based in Sudbury, to serve Northeastern Ontario, one focused on the francophone and allophone community (including international students), and the other on the anglophone community. The project, which is underway and progressing well, assists businesses in navigating and participating in immigrant and migrant settlement and attraction services, programs and administration. In addition, the project is helping to raise awareness of and facilitating access to job matching, payroll subsidy programs, and other employment supports.\n",

      "News Release Text: Federal Minister and Task Force Chair, Marc Garneau, began the meeting by reiterating the importance of ongoing federal and provincial collaboration in order to manage the influx with compassion and in accordance with Canadian law. Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) Ahmed Hussen, added that last summer, and throughout 2017, both levels of governments were successful in responding to the movement of irregular migrants by working together to address challenges as they arose. Minister Hussen underlined new federal investments of $173 million over two years to support the intake and processing of asylum claims, security screening, detentions and removals. This includes an investment of $74 million in the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) to expand capacity and process claims faster. He noted that a 40 percent increase in claims finalization was achieved at the IRB last year due to efficiency measures and that the new funding will support decision-making capacity at the IRB, which will relieve pressures on provincial services. Recently, Minister Hussen met with the ‎High Commissioner of Nigeria where the issue of Nigerians transiting through the U.S. to claim asylum in Canada was discussed.   During his trip to Washington last week, Minister Garneau met with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and raised the issue of irregular migration. Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale will be meeting with DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on the margins of the upcoming G7 Security Ministerial meeting to discuss joint border security and public safety issues, including irregular migration. Minister Hussen concluded by saying that IRCC and Global Affairs Canada (GAC) continue to work together on outreach in the U.S., meeting with organizations and community leaders. As well, GAC’s U.S. mission network continues to proactively communicate how a rules-based immigration system works and correct any misinformation. Moving forward, the members of the Task Force agreed to take concrete actions to ensure a coordinated and effective response to the irregular migration situation. To this end, members announced that they will be working together to assess details of Quebec’s claims for additional financial resources. Officials were directed to explore the development of a possible triage system at or near the Canada-U.S. border. This would include gathering information on asylum claimants’ including their intended destination in Canada with the goal of alleviating pressures on major urban centers and reducing labour shortages in certain regions. Members also agreed to intensify efforts to work constructively with the United States (U.S.) on the issue of irregular migration. At the conclusion of the meeting, Minister Garneau encouraged all members to maintain an open dialogue and work together to address shared challenges. Members also acknowledged that those whose claims have been accepted as genuine refugees fleeing violence and persecution will help grow our country as permanent residents. The Task Force will continue to collaborate and share information moving forward.\n",

      "News Release Text: December 17, 2021              Gatineau, Quebec              Employment and Social Development CanadaCanada’s economic prosperity depends on everyone having a fair chance to succeed. For people employed in minimum-wage jobs trying to support themselves and their families, every dollar makes a difference. Whether it be at the grocery store, in their housing payments or simply making ends meet, affected workers will benefit from increased buying power when the minimum wage rises. That is why, in Budget 2021, the Government of Canada proposed a $15 per hour federal minimum wage. Today, Minister of Labour, Seamus O’Regan Jr. highlighted that this important change will take effect on December 29 for workers in the federally regulated private sector. For those working in provinces or territories where the minimum wage is higher, the higher wage will apply. This amendment represents an important step forward in reducing poverty and inequality in Canada. The amendments made to Part III of the Canada Labour Code to set the new federal minimum wage, also ensure that it will rise with inflation. Every April 1, beginning in 2022, the federal minimum wage will be adjusted (rounded up to the nearest $0.05) based on Canada's Consumer Price Index for the previous calendar year as reported by Statistics Canada.  These changes align with recent updates to federal labour standards, such as hours of work, annual vacations and general holidays, and the introduction of legislation to provide ten days of paid sick leave. Together, these improvements will help ensure that employees in the federally regulated private sector have a robust and modern set of labour standards that reflect the realities of 21st century workplaces. \n",

      "News Release Text: The fast moving current, large number of participants, lack of lifejackets, alcohol consumption, potentially challenging weather conditions, water temperature, and limited rescue resources can create difficult emergency response scenarios that can result in serious injuries or fatalities. Large crowds of people in close proximity also increases the risk of spreading COVID-19. Water temperatures during recent Float Downs averaged in the high 60s º F/ 17-19 º C. Immersion in water below approximately 70 degrees º F/ 21 º C can lead to hypothermia that impairs physical performance and degrades a person’s ability to self-help or swim. Early signs of hypothermia include shivering and loss of coordination and judgment. The marine environment – motion, sun, wind, spray – accelerates the effects of alcohol consumption.  Alcohol can also increase fatigue and susceptibility to the effects of cold water – further impairing a person’s judgment, vision, and reaction time. Past float downs have resulted in tragedy. In 2014, a 19-year-old experienced swimmer drowned during the event, despite more than 36 combined hours of searching by both U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards, as well as numerous local, state, and federal first responders. In 2016, high winds and a heavy downpour led to approximately 1,500 participants requiring assistance when they landed on the Canadian shoreline at Sarnia and Corunna, leaving them stranded, subject to Canadian and U.S. border security. To complicate matters, many of these individuals were without identification, money and means of communication. Some had injuries and were suffering from hypothermia. This is an inherently dangerous activity, especially for minors. As first responders, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard recommend that people do not take part in this event. If you choose to participate you are strongly encouraged to take several precautions: The U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards, supported by a large number of federal, state, provincial, and local agencies, are highly trained professionals with limited resources; we embrace that responsibility, but we – as other first responders – cannot be everywhere. We rely on family members and all users of the marine environment to look out for one another, take care of themselves, wear lifejackets and not drink alcohol while on the water to improve the likelihood that they return home safely.

      "News Release Text: February 12, 2020                        Shawinigan, Quebec                   Parks Canada Agency The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the environment in order to conserve national parks and national marine conservation areas and contribute to the recovery of species at risk. Parks Canada gathered representatives from academic, government and conservation organizations at Auberge des Gouverneurs in Shawinigan yesterday to collectively identify issues related to the conservation of forest and aquatic ecosystems and wetlands beyond the park’s borders. The meeting was an opportunity for contributors to discuss the future of resource protection in La Mauricie National Park, with a focus on biodiversity connectivity. When it comes to long-term conservation, it’s essential to consider the use of the ecosystems adjacent to a park. Parks Canada wants to use landscape ecology concepts to guide its conservation objectives and has consulted with major players in the field to achieve this objective. Parks Canada aims to effectively integrate its conservation efforts with those carried out at the regional level and to adapt its approach within a context of climate change. Knowledge mobilization and cooperation are essential for developing effective conservation measures that are adapted to current biodiversity protection challenges. Now more than ever, La Mauricie National Park is encouraging an approach that protects species at risk and maintains connectivity between habitats and ecological processes in the region’s ecosystems, with the support of regional and First Nations partners. Canada’s network of protected areas plays an important role in helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change by protecting and restoring healthy, resilient ecosystems and contributing to the recovery of species at risk. This meeting also helped inform discussions on La Mauricie National Park’s 2020–2030 Management Plan. Regional conservation efforts and implementation of the approaches outlined in the Management Plan will provide a solid foundation on which we can come together to build a bright future and address emerging environmental challenges such as climate change and protecting species at risk. The Government of Canada is committed to conserving at least 25% of Canada’s ocean waters and lands by 2025 in collaboration with provinces and territories, Indigenous peoples, and other key partners. -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: May 13, 2020 – Ottawa – National Film Board of Canada (NFB) A new experience is opening the doors to the historical seat of Parliament in virtual reality (VR), online and in the classroom. It provides Canadians who are at home during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new way to step inside the centre of federal democracy. Parliament: The Virtual Experience offers an innovative look inside Centre Block, which closed last year for long-term rehabilitation. This landmark building was the site of debates and decisions that shaped Canada for almost 100 years, a rich legacy that is showcased to the public in this new work. The 15-minute experience highlights key public spaces, including the Senate, House of Commons, Library of Parliament and Peace Tower. Each chapter offers a new perspective on Parliament – its history, its art and its role in the lives of Canadians. Parliament: The Virtual Experience is a co-production by the Library of Parliament and the National Film Board of Canada’s (NFB) Interactive Studio. The creative team includes Émilie F. Grenier (creative direction), Dpt. (conception, design and programming), David Drury (music and sound design) and Stéphane Poirier (illustrations). The experience is offered online at no charge. Full details are available at experienceparliament.ca. In VR and Online VR users can download an immersive 3-D journey into the space, which blends photorealism with magical elements, including vivid sound, colour and light. Anyone with Internet access can also explore the complementary online experience, in which a richly illustrated version of this architectural landmark reveals itself as they scroll. In the Classroom Once the public health crisis has passed, teachers across Canada will be able to register for the Classroom Experience and take their students on the ultimate virtual field trip. This one-of-a-kind learning program will send free VR kits to schools across Canada. The kits will contain equipment that allows an entire class to view the VR experience of Parliament simultaneously, as well as lesson plans and in-class activities designed to enhance the experience. The Classroom Experience has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but will launch once compatible with public health guidelines. Interested educators are invited to browse the program website and to check back for updates. “We are thrilled to bring this innovative experience of Parliament to people across Canada while they remain at home. Though we find ourselves in the midst of challenging times, this experience is a unique opportunity to go beyond our walls and step into the heart of Canadian democracy.”-        Dr. Heather Lank, Parliamentary Librarian “The NFB is very pleased to have collaborated with the Library of Parliament and shared its expertise in the creation of engaging experiences with cutting-edge audiovisual technologies. Now, more than ever, democracy, the institutions that embody it and their role in our society have taken on a vital importance. The public will discover our democracy in a new way.”-        Claude Joli-Cœur, Government Film Commissioner and Chairperson of the NFB – 30 – Stay Connected Online Screening Room: NFB.caNFB Facebook | NFB Twitter | NFB Instagram | NFB Blog | NFB YouTube | NFB Vimeo About the NFB\n",

      "News Release Text:  June 11, 2021                        Fort Simpson/Liidlii Kue, NWT                         Parks Canada Agency National parks are gateways to discovering, learning about, and connecting with nature. The network of national heritage places administered by Parks Canada represents the very best that Canada has to offer and tell stories of who we are, including the histories, cultures, and contributions of Indigenous peoples. Today, the management plan for Nahanni National Park Reserve was tabled in Parliament. Reviewed every 10 years, management plans are a requirement of the Canada National Parks Act and guide the management of national historic sites, national parks and national marine conservation areas. The updated plan for Nahanni National Park Reserve outlines the following key strategies:   1.  Nahʔą Kué/Our Home – Sharing the Heart of the Dehcho Sharing the stories, history and culture of the Dene as a central aspect of the visitor experience within a pristine wilderness setting. 2.  Dene Náothę - The Dene Worldview Fostering traditional and contemporary Dene knowledge in management decisions, as well as engaging the next generation in stewardship of the park reserve. 3.  Nahʔą Dehé Kˊeodhi – Taking Care of Nahʔą Dehé Meeting emerging environmental challenges facing Nahanni and active maintenance of the ecological integrity within the park. 4.  Yundáa Gogha Tu Kˊehodí - Waters for Life Protection of water resources for the future and working with partners and communities to maintain water quality. 5.  Reconciling with Indigenous Rights Holders Expanding inclusive management approaches with Indigenous rights holders that have not previously been involved in cooperative management.   The management plan for Nahanni National Park Reserve was based on input from Indigenous communities, including the Dehcho First Nations and Nahʔą Dehé Dene Band, who have cooperatively managed the park reserve for nearly twenty years. The draft plan was revised at later stages in its development to acknowledge and support reconciliation with Indigenous rights holders that have not formally been involved in cooperative management. The plan also reflects the contributions of other partners and stakeholders, local residents, as well as park visitors. Parks Canada is committed to a system of national heritage places that recognizes and honours the historic and contemporary contributions of Indigenous peoples, their histories and cultures, as well as the special relationships Indigenous peoples have with ancestral lands and waters. This updated management plan is a clear demonstration of the Government of Canada’s commitment towards reconciliation and nation-to-nation relationships. Of note, it sets out a path to support Indigenous cultural land use and improve connections to the park reserve, to support ongoing cultural and language revitalization and knowledge transfer from Elders to youth. Through this management plan, Parks Canada will protect an important example of natural heritage in Canada, engage and collaborate with Indigenous peoples, and provide an opportunity for Canadians to experience and discover our environment in new and innovative ways. The Nahanni Management Plan is available for viewing on the Parks Canada website at: https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nt/nahanni/info/plan/plan-2021. \n",

      "News Release Text: People in Fredericton and across Canada deserve to feel safe in their communities. That’s why the Government of Canada is taking action on gun and gang violence with a comprehensive plan that gets guns off our streets and puts more resources into our communities. An important element of this plan is stopping violence before it starts, which is why the government launched the $250 million Building Safer Communities Fund (BSCF). First announced in March 2022, the BSCF supports local initiatives that prevent gun and gang violence and help young people make good choices. Today, the Minister of Public Safety, the Honourable Marco Mendicino, announced that the City of Fredericton will receive up to $945,000 from the BSCF to prevent gun and gang violence across the city. This funding will help address the underlying social conditions that give rise to crime. The BSCF will support community-led projects to combat violence among young people who are involved in gangs, or at risk of joining them. No single program or initiative can tackle the challenge of gun violence on its own. That is why the BSCF is one of many elements in the government’s comprehensive plan to keep Canadians safe from gun crime. This begins at our borders, where we’ve added resources to fight smuggling and stop guns from coming into Canada. The government banned assault-style firearms like the AR-15 two years ago and will soon begin a buyback program to get these weapons of war off of our streets. Finally, the government recently introduced Bill C-21 – Canada’s most significant action on gun violence in a generation – which proposes a national freeze on handguns and new “red flag” laws to address the role of guns in domestic violence. \n",

But the pandemic has had an effect on many of them, too. “Daily routines have been disrupted; plans and hopes put on hold. Between new requirements for work, a lot of added stresses to daily life, caring for vulnerable family members, being separated from loved ones and isolated from social circles, it’s completely natural to feel how I know so many of us have been feeling. “The theme of this year’s Bell Let’s Talk Day—Supporting ourselves and each other—reminds us that talking about our own mental health is an important way to help relieve stress and take care of ourselves. If you are a Veteran, former member of the RCMP, family member or caregiver who needs to talk, you can call VAC’s free and confidential Assistance Service at 1-800-268-7708. Mental health professionals are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. “This spring, it will also become easier for Veterans to obtain Mental Health Benefits coverage. Budget 2021 invested $140 million over five years starting in 2021-22, and $6 million ongoing, so that Veterans who apply for a disability benefit for a mental health condition — as well as those who have already applied — automatically qualify for coverage. Veterans will have up to two years of treatment for conditions like anxiety and depressive disorders, or trauma-and-stressor-related disorders, no matter the final decision on their benefits request. “The past two years have been hard on everyone. On Bell Let’s Talk Day, let’s talk about our mental health and how we can support ourselves and each other this year.”\n",

      "News Release Text: Global Affairs Canada today issued the following statement on the publication of the electoral calendar in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): “Canada notes the publication of the DRC’s electoral calendar, announcing a general election for December, 2018. “Canada encourages the DRC on its path toward free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections, which will allow for the peaceful and democratic transition of power expected by the Congolese people, and in keeping with the spirit of the DRC’s Constitution and the Saint-Sylvestre Accord, which does not allow President Joseph Kabila to stand for re-election for a third term. We also emphasize the crucial importance of devoting all necessary efforts to the organization of elections and to ensuring full respect for human rights at all stages of the electoral process. “Canada calls on all political actors in the DRC to work together for the success of this process. Canada also calls on the authorities to ensure that human rights are fully respected, particularly those related to freedom of expression, the press, peaceful assembly and association, including the release of political prisoners and the need to put an end to politically motivated prosecution. “Canada also encourages the Government of the DRC to take all possible measures to ensure the full participation of women in Congolese politics. “As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the country's authorities must demonstrate the importance they place on human rights and the opening of the democratic space.” Contacts Media Relations OfficeGlobal Affairs Canada343-203-7700media@international.gc.caFollow us on Twitter: @CanadaFP  Like us on Facebook: Canada’s foreign policy - Global Affairs Canada\n",

      "News Release Text: Ottawa, Ontario - The Canadian Coast Guard plays a vital role in protecting our oceans from coast to coast to coast. Under the Oceans Protection Plan, we’re investing in the Canadian Coast Guard to ensure it has modern equipment needed to respond to environmental spills quickly and effectively. These investments will allow it to continue protecting Canada’s waters, coasts and coastal communities from marine pollution. Following an open competitive process, Public Services and Procurement Canada, on behalf of the Canadian Coast Guard, has awarded a $219,226 contract to Margo Supplies Ltd. of High River, Alberta  for the acquisition of 22 wildlife hazing portable kits. This contract includes options for up to 34 additional kits. These kits can be used to move wildlife away from the predicted pathway of a spill or deter them from entering an area where a spill has already occurred. The kits include sound making deterrents such as propane cannons and visual deterrents such as human effigies, bird of prey kites, and balloons.  The $1.5 billion Oceans Protection Plan is the largest investment ever made to protect Canada’s coasts and waterways. This national plan is creating a marine safety system that provides economic opportunities for Canadians today, while protecting our coastlines and clean water for generations to come. This work is being done in close collaboration with Indigenous peoples, local stakeholders and coastal communities.\n",

      "News Release Text: Tax season is upon Ontario residents and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is getting ready to answer questions from taxpayers and make it easier and quicker for them to file their 2022 income tax and benefit return. The CRA wants to make sure each taxpayer receives the benefits and credits they are entitled to. There are many advantages of filing an income tax and benefit return every year. The deadline for most Ontario residents to file their income tax and benefit returns for 2022 is April 30, 2023. Since this date is a Sunday, a return will be considered filed on time if the CRA receives it, or it is postmarked, on or before May 1, 2023. A payment will be considered made on time if the CRA receives it, or a Canadian financial institution processes it, on or before May 1, 2023. Simplified Northern Residents Travel Deduction – The CRA is launching the Simplified Northern Residents Travel Deduction, a pilot project to make it easier for northern residents to determine the lowest return airfare, one of the three amounts required to claim the travel deduction come tax time. Available the week of February 20, 2023, on canada.ca/lowest-return-airfare, the simplified version features tables that identify the lowest return airfare amount found from airports with regularly scheduled commercial flights to a designated city. The airfare tables contain more than 135 airports, almost all of which are located in the prescribed zones. Canada Dental Benefit – The new interim Canada Dental Benefit is available to eligible families earning less than $90,000 per year. It provides financial support for parents and guardians of children under 12 years old if they receive dental care in Canada and do not have access to private dental insurance. For more information, go to Canada Dental Benefit. One-time top-up to the Canada Housing Benefit – The government introduced a one-time $500 payment to help lower-income renters facing housing affordability challenges. Applications are open until March 31, 2023. For more information, go to One-time top-up to the Canada Housing Benefit. First-time home buyers’ tax credit – The amount used to calculate the first-time home buyers’ tax credit has increased to $10,000 for a qualifying home purchased after December 31, 2021. Home accessibility tax credit – For 2022 and later tax years, the annual expense limit of the home accessibility tax credit has increased to $20,000. Climate action incentive payment (CAIP) – If you are eligible, you will automatically get the CAIP four times a year. Since it generally takes two weeks to process electronic returns, we recommend that you and your spouse or common-law partner (if applicable) file your 2022 returns electronically by March 10, 2023, to help in receiving the April 14, 2023, issuance. If you don’t receive the April issuance, the payment will be included in a subsequent payment after your returns are assessed. For more information, go to Climate action incentive payment. Organ and tissue donation initiative – Beginning with the 2022 tax year, you can indicate whether you want to receive information about becoming an organ and tissue donor if you are a resident of Ontario. By ticking the “yes” box in the consent section of your return, you authorize the CRA to give your name and email address to Ontario Health so that they may contact you or send you information about organ and tissue donation. For more information, go to Consent to share contact information – Organ and tissue donor registry. Disability tax credit – For 2021 and later tax years, an individual diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is considered to have met the two times and 14 hours per week requirements for life-sustaining therapy. For more information, go to Disability tax credit. Payment arrangements – If you cannot pay an existing debt in full, you may be eligible for a payment arrangement. Payment arrangement options have been expanded to reflect current realities. The Payment Arrangement Calculator has also been added to My Account and My Business Account. This self-service tool allows you to submit a potential payment arrangement without having to contact the CRA. If the proposed payment arrangement does not meet the CRA payment policy, a CRA officer will reach out to complete the arrangement. You will be able to file your 2022 income tax and benefit return electronically starting on February 20, 2023. If you haven’t already, why not join the nine out of 10 Ontario residents who filed their 2021 tax returns online? When combining online filing with direct deposit, you can receive your tax refund in as little as eight business days. Last year, over 13 million refunds were issued by direct deposit to Canadian taxpayers, which was 78% of all refunds. There are many advantages to filing your taxes. Canadians who had a tax refund in 2022 received an average of $2,092. Another advantage to filing is that you may be eligible to receive federal and provincial benefit and credit payments. Last year, eligible Ontario residents received an average of: To receive benefits and credits, you need to file an income tax and benefit return – even if you have no income to report for 2022 or if your income is tax exempt. Steps to get ready for filing – Not sure where to start? Visit our Get ready to do your taxes page for the latest tax information. We have eight steps that will help you prepare to file. Register for My Account – Over 6.4 million Ontario residents are already registered for My Account. My Account is our online portal for individuals where you can find your tax information and access many of the slips you need to file your income tax and benefit return. You can also: You will also be able to access digital services such as Auto-fill my return and Express NOA in certified tax-filing software. Learn about your taxes – The CRA has launched a free online learning tool to help you do your taxes on your own. This tool provides you with lessons that help you understand what taxes are, why we pay them, how to understand your paycheques, pay stubs, and income tax slips, and finally, how to do your taxes for the first time. Need help doing your taxes? – If you have a modest income, a simple tax situation, and require assistance, a Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) volunteer may be able to do your taxes for free. The CVITP helped over 186,400 Ontario residents complete and file tax returns last year. To find a clinic, please visit our Free tax clinics page.

      "News Release Text: The NAFTA Chief Negotiators confirmed today that although the fifth round of NAFTA negotiations will formally begin on November 17, 2017, some negotiating groups will begin meeting on November 15. Nearly 30 negotiating groups will be meeting during the fifth round, which will conclude on November 21. The three NAFTA ministers—the Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexico’s Secretary of Economy, and Ambassador Robert E. Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative—agreed at the end of round four to allow more space between rounds in order to provide negotiators with enough time to analyze the proposals that all three countries have tabled so far and to conduct internal consultations. In addition, the NAFTA ministers met separately at the recent Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, and instructed the NAFTA Chief Negotiators to focus on advancing discussions on tabled proposals as much as possible. Given the substantive discussions held between the ministers at APEC, the ministers agreed not to attend the fifth round so negotiators can continue to make important progress on key chapters advanced in round four. The Chief Negotiators from Mexico, the United States and Canada will be in constant communication with their respective ministers and will report on the progress reached in round five.

      "News Release Text: The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Region released operational and enforcement highlights covering the period from January 1 to October 31, 2022. The GTA Region is home to approximately 2,200 employees who support over 340 points of services in a geographical area that includes eight of the most populous cities in Ontario. The Region is home to the agency’s largest air, cargo, mail processing, and trade operations in the country. The Region’s primary point of entry is the Toronto Pearson International Airport (TPIA), which is Canada’s largest and busiest international airport, in both size and volume, and serves as a key portal for both travellers and goods entering the country. Building a modern border As part of its Traveller Modernization Initiative, the CBSA has developed new tools and technology to deliver a better and smoother border experience for travellers arriving at Canadian airports.  In 2022, the Agency introduced electronic gates (eGates) as an alternate device for self-service primary processing giving travellers another option to present their customs and immigration declaration.  On June 1, 2022 an eGate pilot was launched at Toronto Pearson International Airport in CBSA’s Primary Inspection Hall located in Terminal 1.  Following the successful pilot, the full eGate deployment was made available to travellers in the summer with the installation of a total of 12 eGate devices.  On August 3, CBSA hosted a media event for a demonstration of the eGates at Toronto Pearson International Airport  (TPIA). Welcoming travellers to Canada From January 1 to October 31, 2022, the GTA Region facilitated the arrival of close to nine million travellers through Toronto Pearson International Airport (TPIA), which accounts for 18.14 percent of national traveller volume (all modes) and 46.2 percent of the national airport volume.  Billy Bishop Airport welcomed 291,952 passengers. As part of a Government of Canada rescue mission, CBSA’s GTA Region welcomed a total of 16 flights of Afghan refugees at Toronto Pearson International Airport (TPIA) landing a total of 5,081 passengers.  Furthermore, since its inception in March, Canada’s Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET) program welcomed over 40,000 Ukrainian nationals at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Supporting the economy Border Services Officers (BSOs) working at the CBSA Commercial Operations District in the GTA Region, processed over 5.1 million commercial shipments into Canada from January 1 and October 31, 2022, and were responsible for clearing approximately 27.84 percent of Canada’s air cargo shipments. The CBSA Trade Program in the GTA remains committed in its efforts to contribute to economic stability.  In 2022, the Program closed 267 verification cases, assessing a total of $129,384,020 in duties, taxes, interest and penalties. One notable case involved the valuation verification on a company that imports bicycles, parts, accessories and clothing. It was determined that the importer had several additions to the price paid or payable, including costs for distribution centres and fulfilling orders. There were also samples of the undervaluation of select goods. As a result of the verification, $3,470,025 in duties, GST, Special Import Measures Act (SIMA), interest and Administrative Monetary Penalties (AMPS) were assessed against the company. Protecting Canadians The CBSA’s GTA Region is determined in its role to facilitate the entry of legitimate travel and trade, while protecting the safety and security of Canadians.  Between January 1 and October 31, 2022, GTA officers made 13,723 seizures including suspected narcotics; weapons, including firearms and replica firearms; food/plant/animal and general commodities across our airport, cargo, and mail processing operations.  The GTA Region conducted 50.5 percent of all enforcement actions completed by the CBSA. NARCOTICS Unlawful organizations have continued their attempts to smuggle prohibited items and contraband into the country. Between January 1 and October 31, 2022, there were over 4,000 seizures of various kinds of narcotics in the GTA Region.  Examples of notable seizures that took place in the GTA Region during this period: The GTA Region enforcement activities play a major role in stopping dangerous goods from entering into Canada. In January 2022, GTA Region Intelligence-led enforcement resulted in the successful interception of the largest shipment of cocaine in CBSA history totaling 1.584 tonnes of cocaine. This enforcement was driven by Project OBANEBERRY, a joint project with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Through extensive intelligence file development and analysis, GTA Intelligence developed critical, actionable intelligence targets. One of the targeted shipments arrived in the Atlantic Region, and was examined at the port of St. John, New Brunswick. Atlantic Region Intelligence and Port of Entry teams were critical in successfully locating the concealed narcotics. The seizure was achieved over a period of multiple days due to the sophisticated and challenging concealment. Once complete, the GTA Intelligence section jointly arranged and participated in the successful controlled delivery of this shipment to Brantford Ontario that resulted in the RCMP arresting the subject of interest.  In November 2022, the subject plead guilty and sentencing is yet to be determined. FIREARMS: Firearms smuggling is a serious criminal offence, and the Agency has a range of measures in place to combat it.  This year, GTA Region BSOs seized 4,733 replica firearms, 12,710 prohibited weapons, and 503 firearms.  In January 2022, multiple firearms parts were seized by Southern Ontario Region (SOR) officers at a facility in Windsor, Ontario. These seized items were referred to the Greater Toronto Area Region’s (GTAR) Intelligence and Investigations Operations Division (IIOD) for further investigation as the importer resided in York Region. Initial investigative steps identified that the importer had a lifetime ban from possessing firearms and had an extensive criminal history. Search Warrants for buildings and vehicles in possession of the main target were authorized by a Justice of the Peace.  GTAR IIOD executed the search warrants in February 2022 where the following items were identified and seized: Shortly after these seizures, the main target was arrested by GTAR IIOD Criminal Investigators and charged with approximately 60 firearms related offences under the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. In October, GTA Commercial Operations BSOs identified a package destined for an address in Woodstock, ON that was suspected of having prohibited devices. After this package was intercepted, investigators from the GTA Criminal Investigation Section and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP)-Provincial Weapons Enforcement Unit (PWEU) obtained and executed a search warrant that led to the discovery of several firearms parts, devices and tools utilized to manufacture “ghost guns”, which are un-serialized and untraceable firearms.  “Ghost Guns” can be manufactured at home, purchased and sold online or elsewhere without government oversight.  Law enforcement also seized three 3D printers – one of which was in the process of printing parts needed to build “ghost guns.”  A fully assembled and loaded “ghost gun”, two 3D printed frames as well as some morphine pills, cocaine, stolen property and cash were also seized during the execution of the search warrant. Collaborating with Indigenous communities In April of 2022, a delegation of 130 First Nations, Inuit and Métis leaders travelled to the Vatican, where Pope Francis issued a formal apology for the treatment of Indigenous people in Canada by the Catholic Church. Due to the sensitive nature of the travel, GTA Region’s Corporate Programs and Integration Management Division created an action plan to facilitate their return to Canada. This involved a gate greeting at the aircraft by members of the Region’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement Team and the CBSA Indigenous Affairs Secretariat, where the delegation was escorted through the customs process to ensure there would be no issues or delays in processing.  As the delegation travelled with cultural property and sacred goods, it was ensured that all the necessary permit requirements were met and completed ahead of time, eliminating the requirement for CBSA to endorse any documentation upon export or re-importation as it was completed in advance of the arrival. The GTA’s Regional Indigenous Employees’ Circle has been active in its role as a support mechanism and community touchstone for Indigenous and non-Indigenous allies over the past year.  Working in partnership with the Region’s Committee for Diversity and Inclusion and the Anti-Racism Committee, the Circle continues to strive to bring awareness of the Indigenous experience within and outside of the CBSA, through open discussions held monthly, and participation in events marking days that are significant to the Indigenous communities.  In 2022, the National Day of Truth and Reconciliation was marked by a series of events including traditional ceremonies performed by BSO (Ret.) Elder John Keeshig and Elder Chastity Jenner, who were gracious enough to share their knowledge of traditional practices with GTA staff at two different CBSA sites located in the Region. In March, on the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CBSA GTA Region members of the Circle and non-Indigenous allies gathered in solidarity at the Inuit Inukshuk located at Toronto Pearson International Airport.  The Circle is committed to establishing a safe space for Indigenous employees at all levels through meaningful action and open communication on this important path toward reconciliation.  Associated links\n",

      "News Release Text: Today, the Canadian Armed Forces marks the 5th anniversary of leading NATO’s multinational enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group in Latvia. Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, NATO Allies agreed at the 2016 Summit in Warsaw to establish an enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in the eastern part of the Alliance, in order to strengthen deterrence measures. Canada, as the Framework Nation for eFP in Latvia, is responsible for leading a ten-nation multinational battle group composed of Albania, Canada, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain, and for coordinating with Latvia and the contributing nations to help set the tone, pace and vision for this Battle Group. The eFP Battle Group works within the Latvian Armed Forces’ infantry brigade, conducting joint training to be able to respond effectively to an attack and remains a tangible reminder that an attack against one NATO member is an attack against all members. In March 2022, Canada also announced its intent to renew its multi-year commitment to Operation REASSURANCE. During her recent visit to Brussels, Defence Minister Anita Anand joined with other contributing nations to eFP, as well as the Latvian Minister of Defence, Artis Pabriks, to mark this anniversary of the Battle Group, which formed part of the biggest reinforcement of NATO’s collective defence in a generation.\n",

      "News Release Text: Today, Patrick Weiler, Member of Parliament for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea-to-Sky Country, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, and Bowinn Ma, Member of British Columbia’s Legislative Assembly for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, on behalf of the Honourable Josie Osborne, B.C.’s Minister of Municipal Affairs, announced funding to improve active transportation in West Vancouver and on Bowen Island. For the occasion, they were joined by Mary-Ann Booth, Mayor of West Vancouver, and Gary Ander, Mayor of Bowen Island. Modern and well-designed active transportation networks allow users to safely move between important city landmarks such as main streets, schools, parks, public squares and transit hubs. Active transportation projects offer alternative commuting options, encourage physical activity, and help reduce air pollution. In West Vancouver, a section of the Baden Powell Trail will be restored to improve users’ comfort and safety, and ensure long-term sustainability. Work includes regrading and resurfacing the trail, installing new steps, re-establishing eroding sections, grubbing and clearing, installing drainage, and other works. On Bowen Island, a new multi-use path will be constructed alongside the main road and a retaining wall will be built to separate motorized vehicles from the path users. The 1.4 km long path connect the BC Ferries’ terminal to Artisan Square. The Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia are investing more than $875,000 in these two projects through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program’s new COVID-19 Community Resilience Stream. Canada is contributing over $700,000, and B.C. is contributing $175,000.\n",

      "News Release Text: [If not already acknowledged… I would like to acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabe people.] Good morning/afternoon! [Acknowledge hosts and guests] I am delighted to join you on this eve of Europe Day. Prime Minister Trudeau has said of the example the EU’s commitment to collaboration has set for our world: “The EU is a truly remarkable achievement and an unprecedented model for peaceful cooperation. Canada knows that an effective European voice on the global stage is not just preferable, it is essential.” Peaceful cooperation has also defined the relationship Canada and the European Union have developed and maintained – a relationship that continues to grow stronger and to make each of our nations stronger. It is a relationship built not only on shared history but also on enduring commitments to the protection of democratic ideals, the defence of human rights and promotion internationally of multilateralism, the rule of law and freer trade. It is a friendship strengthened by our determination to build diverse and inclusive societies, and to make gender equality a priority. I cannot sufficiently stress the importance of maintaining our enduring relationship during these volatile times. The value of furthering a constructive dialogue between friends. Of sharing best practices to maintain peace and security. Of maintaining vigilance against cyber threats. Of standing strong for democratic values amid the rising tide of populist disrupters. In a world in which forces seek to divide, we are united. This is an election year for Canada, as it is for a number of European countries and the EU as a whole. Elections embody the best of our democratic processes. Yet, over the past decade, efforts to dim democracy’s beacon have escalated in scale, in scope and in sophistication. Malevolent campaigns to distort and polarize. To undermine faith in our democratic institutions. It is imperative that we be fully prepared to repel threats that may emerge, and to protect and strengthen our democratic institutions. A number of democracies in Europe and across the globe have weathered increasingly hostile attempts to disrupt and divide. Canada has watched and learned. We have taken action to put in place a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to recognize, identify and respond to threats. It is one of many things we have in common with our European allies. Canada and the European Union enjoy a steadfast bond. The European Union’s relationship with Canada is the EU’s oldest formal relationship with an industrialized country. Canada and Europe signed the Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1959. The Framework Agreement for Commercial and Economic Cooperation was formalized in 1976. Our relationship has continued to grow stronger. Together, we established the Transatlantic Declaration in 1990. In 1996, the Joint Canada-EU Political Declaration and Action Plan outlined commitments to collaborate in a number of areas. The Canada-EU Partnership Agenda was agreed in 2004. In October 2016, collaborative bilateral dialogue between the EU-Canada Joint Ministerial Committee was furthered via the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA). And in September 2017, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) provisionally came into force, creating new commercial opportunities for Canadian and EU businesses, and forging closer links between our economies. We have signed a number of other sectoral agreements over the years, in areas such as education, customs, competition, veterinary issues, science, technology and nuclear matters. Today, the EU represents Canada’s second largest trade and investment partner and is a natural ally on many foreign and security issues. Moreover, the EU represents to Canada a trusted friend. In turbulent times, as hatemongers seek to tear down, let us celebrate what we have built up. Together. Thank you. Merci.\n",

      "News Release Text: October 5, 2017 – Ottawa, ON The draft environmental impact statement (EIS), in both official languages, for the proposed In Situ Decommissioning of the Whiteshell Reactor #1 Project submitted by the proponent, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, is now available to the public. The main body of the EIS, the appendices and the executive summary can be accessed by visiting the Documents – For Public Participation section of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry for the In Situ Decommissioning of the Whiteshell Reactor #1 Project. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is seeking comments during a 75-day public comment period on the draft EIS. The draft EIS provides an analysis of the project’s potential environmental effects and measures to mitigate those potential impacts. A technical review of the draft EIS by CNSC staff, and federal and provincial departments and agencies, is being carried out concurrently with the public review. The public comment period gives members of the public, Indigenous groups, and government departments and agencies an opportunity to submit their views in writing to the CNSC on the adequacy of the information presented in the EIS, as measured against the Generic Guidelines for the Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (the Guidelines), and on the technical merit of the information presented. The Guidelines provide direction to the proponent and identify the information that is required in the EIS. Written comments in either official language must be submitted by December 19, 2017. All comments on the draft EIS will be posted on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry in the language in which they were received. Following receipt of public comments on the draft EIS, CNSC staff will consider all submissions received in making its determination on whether the EIS is satisfactory or whether further information is required from the proponent. Should further information be required, the proponent will be requested to submit the necessary information until CNSC staff are satisfied with a final EIS. In addition, CNSC staff will ensure responses are provided to all comments received from members of the public and Indigenous groups. Following receipt of a final EIS, CNSC staff will prepare a CEAA 2012 EA report (EA report), to inform the Commission's EA decision. The EA report will be available to the public and Indigenous groups 60 days prior to the Commission's EA public hearing. The day and time of the hearing are to be determined at a later date by the Commission. Public participation will be offered through the submission of written and/or oral interventions.\n",

      "News Release Text: Rivière-Rouge, Quebec, July 8, 2022 – Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED) Supporting the development and promotion of regional assets contributes to economic development in Quebec’s regions. That is why Stéphane Lauzon, Member of Parliament for Argenteuil-La Petite-Nation and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Rural Economic Development, on behalf of the Honourable Pascale St-Onge, Minister of Sport and Minister responsible for CED, today announced a non-repayable contribution of $590,100 for Société de développement du réservoir Kiamika during a visit to the Kiamika regional park. This CED support will allow the corporation to enhance tourism offerings in the Hautes-Laurentides by developing the facilities in Blueberry Bay. This contribution from CED will allow the corporation to build a welcome centre that will include a building, lavatories, rest areas and a parking lot. The project aims to provide the region with a major four-season national and international tourist destination and will lead to the creation of four jobs. Société de développement du réservoir Kiamika is the non-profit organization responsible for developing and managing the Kiamika regional park in the Hautes-Laurentides. Inaugurated in 2013, this park sets itself apart from other tourist attractions due to offerings for visitors seeking an escape to the great outdoors. The Government of Canada recognizes and supports businesses and organizations that are a source of pride in their communities. Quebec’s economic recovery relies on organizations with strong roots in the regional economy. They are major contributors to growth, as well as key assets in rebuilding a stronger, more resilient, greener, and more just economy for all. “Our government recognizes that the tourism sector plays an important role in the economic recovery. That is why developing the offerings in Blueberry Bay is a key project for the Kiamika regional park—as well as for the future of the Hautes-Laurentides. Positioning this park as a major tourist attraction in the area represents enormous potential, generating direct and immediate benefits for all businesses in the region.\" Stéphane Lauzon, Member of Parliament for Argenteuil-La Petite-Nation and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Rural Economic Development “Projects such as this one involving the Kiamika regional park are central to the growth of our communities and are part of our government’s economic recovery plan. The economic vitality of the Hautes-Laurentides region is undeniable! With support from our government, these new facilities will certainly help to promote all that the region has to offer. There is no doubt that the success and benefits of the Blueberry Bay project will be felt throughout Quebec and the rest of Canada.” The Honourable Pascale St-Onge, Member of Parliament for Brome-Missisquoi, Minister of Sport and Minister responsible for CED “This major project involves building a Scandinavian-style welcome centre with an educational component to develop year-round offerings. Ultimately, the main building in Blueberry Bay will become an ecotourism centre that teaches visitors about living with nature. The project is clearly rooted in the principles of sustainable development. Its main pillars are based on the three axes of sustainable development, namely social, economic and environmental development.” Marie-Claude Provost, CEO, Société de développement du réservoir Kiamika Media RelationsCanada Economic Development for Quebec Regionsmedia@dec-ced.gc.ca Ariane Joazard-Bélizaire Press Secretary Office of the Minister of Sport and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regionsariane.joazard-belizaire@pch.gc.ca Follow CED on social media Consult CED’s news\n",

      "News Release Text: March 25, 2021 – Iqaluit, Nunavut – Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries are key economic drivers in the territory, supporting the livelihood of  generations of Inuit. These industries are a source of sustainable economic development in Nunavut, providing  jobs for Nunavummiut, as well as presenting a significant potential for growth. That is why the Government of Canada has been there to support the industry over the last year. The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) has long been a supporter of Nunavut's  fishing and sealing industries, recognizing their positive economic impacts in the territory. For over a decade, CanNor has worked with federal departments and partners, including the Government of Nunavut, Inuit organizations, and businesses, to invest in extensive fisheries research, marketing, and professional training. Today, the Honourable Daniel Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for CanNor, met with members of Nunavut's fishing industry, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, and the Government of Nunavut. During that meeting, he highlighted investments of over $3.2 million that have been made to support six projects that will continue to grow and diversify Nunavut's economy. This investment builds on CanNor's support to the development of Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries. These investments support projects that are providing safe work environments for employees on vessels and in plants during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projects that are helping to examine innovative ways to expand and promote Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries into new markets, support exploratory fisheries (focusing on redfish and char), as well as small scale inshore fisheries exploration in the communities of Arviat, Kinngait, and Sanikiluaq. These investments will bring new jobs and opportunities for Nunavummiut. By investing in Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries, the Government of Canada is helping position the territory's economy for a strong recovery, while supporting the government's commitment to create over one million jobs across Canada, restoring employment to previous levels.\n",

      "News Release Text: The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, today issued the following statement in response to the United States’ request for the establishment of a dispute settlement panel regarding Canada’s administration of its dairy tariff rate quota (TRQ) policies under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA): “Canada is a strong proponent of rules-based multilateral trade and believes that international trade will play an important role in the global recovery from COVID-19. “We take our obligations under international agreements seriously. This includes those under CUSMA with the United States, our closest trading partner. “Canada is disappointed that the United States has requested a dispute settlement panel. “Under CUSMA, Canada agreed to provide some additional market access to the United States for dairy while successfully defending our supply management system and dairy industry. “We are confident that our policies are in full compliance with our CUSMA TRQ obligations, and we will vigorously defend our position during the dispute settlement process. “Our government will continue to stand up for Canada’s dairy industry, farmers and workers and will continue to preserve, protect and defend our supply management system.”\n",

      "News Release Text: Dr. Guy Berthiaume, Librarian and Archivist of Canada Exhibition launch “Canada: Who Do We Think We Are?” Ottawa, Ontario June 5, 2017 Check against delivery Good evening, and welcome. I’d like to begin by acknowledging that we are gathered on traditional Algonquin land. Thank you Richard, for agreeing to be our MC. A special welcome to Sean Casey, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, and to Andrew Campbell, the Senior Executive Director of the Federal Secretariat for Canada 150, and to all our distinguished guests. The 150th anniversary of Confederation is a unique occasion for Canadians to get to know themselves. We are at a significant point in our history. The concept of two founding peoples that defined our history for years has been steadily evolving. And now, the First Nations, the Métis Nation and the Inuit are finally acknowledged as essential to the Canadian identity. Moreover, the arrival of thousands of new Canadians from all walks and conditions of life makes this an excellent time to review and redefine that identity—to stamp it clearly with the hallmarks of inclusion and diversity. The 150th anniversary also provides us with an excellent opportunity to take stock of the role of memory institutions like libraries, archives and museums—the custodians of our distant past and our recent history. The stories that illustrate where we come from and where we are going are found on our shelves, on our walls, on our screens, and in our display cases. And as our birthday approaches, I can’t think of a better time to share our stories and demonstrate our value than right now. * * * Welcome to Canada: Who Do We Think We Are? Tonight’s exhibition, developed by Library and Archives Canada in recognition of the 150th anniversary of Confederation, is full of surprising truths. The idea is to make Canadians stop and ask themselves—what does it really mean to be a Canadian? To get Canadians thinking about their identity, LAC has launched its largest exhibition in recent memory, and brought together some of its most fascinating and rarely-seen items. The timing couldn’t be better. 395 Wellington Street, a building that so many people regard with great affection, is also celebrating a birthday. It was on June 20, 1967, just in time for Canada’s centennial, that the National Library and Archives building was officially opened. I invite you to listen to the opening ceremonies, which you can find on our website—the sense of pride is both palpable and powerful. And I invite you to visit our pop-up exhibition about the building’s birthday in the Pellan Room on the second floor. It’s well worth a look. And now back to the business at hand. I want to offer a special thanks to our curator, Madeleine Trudeau, and all the staff who contributed their time, their expertise and their ideas to this exceptional exhibition. There were a number of challenges to overcome during the installation, and both Myriam Godin and Serge Tessier deserve special recognition for their work in making it happen. It has truly been a labour of love. The work of restoring Canada’s first formal Coat of Arms, carved in wood around 1923, took over 400 hours alone. For the many hours of conservation work devoted to making all these items look their best, I would also like to acknowledge our conservation team, Susannah Kendall, Doris St-Jacques, Manise Marston, Tania Passafiume, Mary Piper Hough, and Véronique Gendron. And in collection management, Kristen Stanley and Jean-Michel Smith. Thanks also to contracting, security, and communications. I am absolutely delighted that we can put these original items on display here at 395 Wellington Street—because there is nothing like the power of an original. *** Once you’ve had a chance to play a round of the Oh! Canada board game or watch a clip from the television series R.C.M.P, follow the snowshoe tracks to a “treasure room” of rare originals, on display in Room C. These include: ·        —to name a few! The exhibition does not confine itself to Canada’s first formal 150 years, but also looks back to earlier periods when figures like Champlain were considering the potential of the country. Some images may provoke a smile, such as a 1944 image of the “typical” Canadian family. In a darker vein, are representations of past attitudes toward immigration, for example, and the country’s First Nations peoples. But what all of these artifacts confirm is the unique and enduring role of LAC as the official “memory” or “mirror” of our country. Our collection paints a picture of Canada’s past, which is as complete as possible. To make the point, the exhibition brings together records from the broad spectrum of our collecting areas: heraldry, music recordings, stamps, oil paintings, and census documents. Books and published materials side by side with unpublished manuscripts. And, of course, records of private citizens as well as those of the Government of Canada. And all of it helps to remind viewers of LAC’s important role in preserving Canada’s national story. Thank you.\n",

      "News Release Text: Energy efficiency can save Canadians money, help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a clean economy that includes good, middle-class jobs. With the value of the energy efficiency market expected to grow to $550 billion by the year 2035, Canada has the opportunity to promote energy efficiency and deliver economic growth through investments in innovation. Through the voluntary leadership of businesses and organizations, we can see the transition to a low-carbon economy in action. Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable Jim Carr, today recognized the national winners of the 2018 ENERGY STAR® Canada Participant Awards, and the first certified ENERGY STAR commercial and institutional buildings in the country, for helping Canada build a clean energy future and address global climate change. Among the award winners are one organization and eight buildings in Quebec. The ENERGY STAR Canada Participant Awards — now in their 15th year — recognize organizations that have demonstrated excellence in promoting the most energy-efficient products and new homes available on the market in Canada. They represent utilities, manufacturers, retailers, associations and homebuilders that are helping Canadian consumers and businesses save money while also addressing climate change. In March, the ENERGY STAR Canada program expanded to include the certification of seven types of commercial and institutional buildings, which encourages and recognizes top energy performance in commercial offices, K-12 schools, hospitals, medical offices, senior care communities and residential care facilities, supermarkets and food stores, and ice and curling rinks. The “Who will be the first?” challenge distinguishes buildings that are amongst the first certified buildings in Canada. For the complete list of this year’s winners, please visit 2018 Award Winner Profiles. The Minister also announced that automotive and commercial baking sectors now have access to Energy Performance Indicator (EPI) benchmarking tools. The ENERGY STAR for Industry certification, launched In August 2017, is designed to help Canadian manufacturers reduce energy costs and remain competitive.\n",

These assets are vital to the country’s trade and economic competitiveness. In this era of rapidly moving global supply chains, they are part of a transportation system that must be reliable, efficient and resilient to various stressors, including climate and weather. Mr. Kent Hehr, Member of Parliament for Calgary Centre, on behalf of the Honourable Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport, today announced funding that will help us understand how climate change affects federal transportation assets. Through the Transportation Assets Risk Assessment Program, the Government of Canada is investing over $290,000 in Alberta’s airports to strengthen the transportation system and address the various stressors caused by climate and extreme weather events. With the funding, Calgary Airport Authority will develop a screening process to evaluate the potential disruptions extreme weather could cause to the daily operations of Calgary International Airport and Springbank Airport. By funding projects that assess climate risk, the Government of Canada is taking action to protect Canadians and their communities from the effects of climate change while strengthening the resilience of the transportation system.\n",

      "News Release Text: To the Beyond Labels Symposium Evening ReceptionOttawa, OntarioSeptember 27, 2017  Check against delivery Thank you, so much, Marie-Claude, for that kind introduction, and it is indeed a pleasure to be here, however briefly, tonight to support the fantastic work of the Beyond Labels Symposium. I’m really pleased that my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Matt DeCourcey, is here to say a few words to you as well. But first, I want to acknowledge the traditional territory of the Algonquin people and to express my sincere appreciation to the Canadian Human Rights Commission for not only organizing this event, but also for your ongoing work in promoting equality of opportunity, ensuring individuals are protected from any forms of discrimination, and for being a very strong and substantive voice for diversity and inclusion in our great country. As has been alluded to, this symposium comes at a time where we’re celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Canadian Human Rights Act, but also the 150th anniversary of Canada, the 35th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and Section 35 of the Constitution Act. And I think that events like this and milestones like this give us an opportunity to reflect on where we’ve come from, where we are right now, and where we want to go as we continue as a country to fulfill our goals, our essential mandate of ensuring human rights for everybody and as we move beyond labels. So I love my notes, but I wanted to reflect maybe a little bit about my own reflections in this incredible period of time that we’re in as a country in terms of my own journey. And I know you benefited from hearing from some of my colleagues this morning, but I’m proud to come from the Musgamagw, Tsawataineuk, and Laich-kwil-tach people on the west coast of British Columbia. And I was raised by an incredible father and mother and extended family, particularly my grandmother Pugladee, who is the matriarch of our clan. My traditional name is Puglaas, and my grandmother and my parents taught me to be proud of who I am, to always remember where I came from, and to understand and recognize the rights that I have in this country and to never forget it. And my grandmother said, “If you work hard, Jody, if you have a plan, you can accomplish anything you want to accomplish,” and I believed her. And I still believe her, and it’s those teachings that have carried me throughout my life. And I come from an Indigenous community that is very communitarian, and every single person in our community has a role to play. And if people are prevented from playing their role in the community, the community suffers. So again, I bring this to my work as a proud Member of Parliament for the riding of Vancouver-Granville and certainly as the first Indigenous Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. I’m incredibly proud to be an Indigenous person in this country, but I’m equally proud to be a Canadian. And as I reflected on the milestones that we are at right now, I think that we have an opportunity as a country looking to the next 150 years to again reflect on where we’ve come from, where we are right now, and where we want to go and how we define ourselves as Canadians. I believe that we need to ensure that we recognize the diversity amongst us, but know what fundamentally unites us in terms of equality and inclusion, in terms of compassion and the values that we all share in terms of wanting to move forward and take advantage of opportunities. I am honoured to be in this position, to be able to be the champion of the Charter, to be able to ensure that the space that we have in this country ensures equality and inclusion. As Minister of Justice and as a member of the government, an example of where we can do more and we are doing more, I was incredibly proud – brought me to tears – when Bill C-16 passed Parliament last session. Thank you. This is an opportunity that we were able to capitalize on, and capitalize on the incredible work that advocates and the trans community have been pushing for for years and years and years, and no longer is it acceptable to have discrimination in any form in our country. And as the Minister, my reflections on where we’re at right now is I believe that we as Canadians are most comfortable and confident when we live in a caring and compassionate society under a legal and political system that will protect us regardless of our sex, regardless of our race, our national or ethnic origin, the colour of our skin, our faith, our age, our mental and physical abilities or our sexual orientation. It is my commitment to all of you amazing human rights activists that are gathered here to have these discussions that you have a champion in the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada and the champion as a proud Canadian from a small fishing community off the west coast of British Columbia. And I want to just acknowledge the important work that the Canadian Human Rights Commission does. I’m grateful for the ongoing role that you play in bringing people together, in raising awareness and guiding people in finding and ensuring ways to equal opportunity for everyone. This symposium is a perfect example. Everybody in this room is a champion of human rights and anything that you do to ensure equality and inclusion in this country is important to ensure that we all collectively live up to what my grandmother told me, “Anything is possible if you work hard and you have a plan.” And every single person in this country has a role to play and we’re all going to be ensured that we commit to making everybody be able to achieve their dreams. Thank you so much for all the work that you do. It really means a lot, and it propels me in my role. Gilakas’la. Thank you very much. -30-\n",

The announcement was made on behalf of the Honourable Ginette Petitpas Taylor, Minister of Official Languages and Minister responsible for ACOA. For the full list of projects, please see backgrounder. The CCRF was launched in June 2021. The Fund provides $500 million over two years to Canada’s regional development agencies (RDAs) to invest in shared and inclusive public spaces. As public health restrictions ease, the Government of Canada remains committed to investing in shared spaces to make them safer, greener and more accessible.

      "News Release Text: “Her name was Rita Hester. She was a Black transgender woman who was brutally murdered in her own apartment and still today her case remains unsolved. Her tragic death spurred the creation of the Transgender Day of Remembrance in 1999.  On November 20th each year, people around the world remember and honour the life of Rita Hester and all Trans, Two-Spirit, and gender diverse people who have lost their lives due to anti-trans violence.  It is a day to mourn those who might otherwise be forgotten. A day to stand up against discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression, including racism against Black, Indigenous, and racialized Trans and gender diverse people. More than 20 years later, Trans and non-binary communities continue to face harassment and violence in their daily lives and misinformation about these communities is on the rise. This harsh reality reminds us that we all must protect Trans rights, promote inclusion, and expand protections related to gender identity. Further, the Government of Canada is focused on protecting Canadians from the harmful practice of conversion therapy and the development and implementation of Canada’s first-ever LGBTQ2 Action Plan, because we know that when everyone is included, our communities are stronger. As Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, and on behalf of the Government of Canada, I encourage everyone to reflect on injustices towards trans communities and think about we how we can build a more inclusive future.”  Associated Links\n",

      "News Release Text: April 7, 2021 — Chatham, Ontario The fish- and seafood-processing sector is a key contributor to our economy and food system, and one that has been hit hard by the impacts of COVID-19. The Government of Canada is supporting processors in this region to ensure their future viability. Today, Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament for Windsor–Tecumseh, on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for FedDev Ontario, announced a total FedDev Ontario investment of nearly $1.5 million through Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF) to support four companies in the Chatham–Kent region, the world’s largest freshwater commercial fishing port and one of Ontario’s key fish- and seafood-processing regions. With funding support, these four processors will be able to cover fixed operating expenses, including COVID-19 safety measures, utilities, insurance and employee wages. They will be able to purchase personal protective equipment required for employees, and retrofit shared workspaces to comply with social distancing measures. Additionally, they will be able to focus on retaining their skilled labour force and attracting new talent to their hardworking teams. A&A Marine Foods, a family-owned freshwater fishing and processing business that specializes in the processing, packing and cold storage of freshwater fish for wholesale and retail sales in Canada and the United States, is receiving $500,000 in support through RRRF. When the pandemic hit, demand from the food service industry significantly decreased, forcing the company to temporarily close its operations and pivot to grow its presence in Canada. A&A Marine Foods employs more than 30 full-time, skilled employees in Blenheim. Great Lakes Food Company, a harvester and processor of freshwater rainbow smelt from Lake Erie, is receiving $362,000 in support through RRRF. As a result of COVID-19, the company is experiencing a decrease in demand from its largest clients, including buffets, bars and restaurants in the United States and Japan, leading to a decline in sales and an increase in direct costs. Great Lakes Food Company employs 38 skilled employees in Chatham. John O’s Foods Inc., a fish processor and wholesaler of fresh and frozen freshwater fish, is receiving $195,000 in support through RRRF. As the second largest producer of lake fish in Ontario, serving both United States and Canadian markets, the company’s revenues have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 on its primary clients in the food service industry. John O’s Foods Inc. employs 70 skilled employees in Wheatley. Presteve Foods Limited, a harvester, processor and distributor of wholesale freshwater fish and seafood from all five Great Lakes and other North American inland lakes, is receiving $400,000 in support through RRRF. As its primary customers in the restaurant industry have been severely impacted by COVID-19, the company is experiencing a 66 percent decrease in sales, and was forced to temporarily shut down production for one month at the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Presteve Foods Limited employs 138 skilled employees in Wheatley.\n",

      "News Release Text: On December 29, 2021, as a result of the vigilance of staff members, a package containing contraband and unauthorized items was seized at Matsqui Institution, a medium security federal institution. The contraband and unauthorized items seized included crystal methamphetamine, fentanyl, crack cocaine, cannabis shatter, one phone charger and accessories. The total estimated institutional value of this seizure is $70,600. The police have been notified and the institution is investigating. The Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) uses a number of tools to prevent drugs from entering its institutions. These tools include ion scanners and drug-detector dogs to search buildings, personal property, inmates and visitors. CSC is heightening measures to prevent contraband from entering its institutions in order to help ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone. CSC also works in partnership with the police to take action against those who attempt to introduce contraband into correctional institutions. CSC has set up a telephone tip line for all federal institutions so that it may receive additional information about activities relating to security at CSC institutions. These activities may be related to drug use or trafficking that may threaten the safety and security of visitors, inmates and staff members working at CSC institutions. The toll-free number, 1‑866‑780‑3784, helps ensure that the information shared is protected and that callers remain anonymous. -30-\n",

      "News Release Text: The Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today welcomed the adoption of the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act and amendments to the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA). These changes are the result of cross-partisan collaboration and strong leadership by the sponsors of this legislation in the Senate and House of Commons. This new law enables Canada to take further action to respond to cases of human rights violations and significant acts of corruption anywhere in the world. Canada will have the ability to impose asset freezes and travel bans on those responsible for these reprehensible acts or their accomplices. Amendments to SEMA allow Canada to impose economic sanctions when gross and systematic violations of human rights are happening in a foreign state, or for acts of significant corruption by foreign public officials or their associates. This law and the SEMA amendments bolster Canada’s broad suite of existing human rights and anti-corruption tools, and ensure that Canada’s sanctions law is calibrated to deal with current international realities. Canada will continue to take a comprehensive approach to address each unique case, which may include the use of sanctions, as necessary.\n",
