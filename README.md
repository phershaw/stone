### A Tool to Understand Government by Reading What Government Writes. 

## Motivation
Governments produce a lot of information. Just look at the Canadian federal government; they can put out 20 - 100+ pieces of content daily. Traditionally, journalists would synthesize that information into user content that provided essential context. Unfortunately, just as governments dramatically increased the data they create, funding for journalists began a steep decline. This has led to decreasing trust in institutions and may hinder the implementation of sound public policy.

I hope journalism and public policy development can be augmented by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques, increasing transparency and improving decision-making.

## The Problem Area
Programmatically analyze government communications to appreciate its central themes, significant policy changes, and tone.

## The Users

Citizens: Citizens benefit from understanding how government communications shift policy in the context of past actions and expected results.
Public Servants: Public servants can use this understanding to improve communication strategies and develop new ideas, considering past government approaches.
Decision Makers: Key decision makers would value context about the history of a decision and understanding of the effects of past communication strategies.

## Data

All government communications are posted to canada.ca/news. 

I am going to download all communications, and analyze the data for key themes, locations, departments, and look at patterns over time.

If possible, I will contrast this analysis with public polling.
